## Superluminal Inc
Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19

## Summary
Our company mission is to develop the best IOT technologies and provide top tier customer service. 
We create b2b solutions to streamline the business of our customers through digital technologies and we offer expertise in software, hardware development and utilizing microcontrollers and we have vast experience in building wired and wireless data transmission networks for the purposes of tracking and managing industrial systems.

## Company Information (required)
Our company "Superluminal Inc" was founded in 2019 and is based in the places of presence of our customers – Los-Angeles, Germany and Moscow. In the US and Germany, we are building out a service for asset tracking and cold chain management based on the Helium ecosystem. In Russia, we are concentrating resources on the development of software and devices in the oil and medical industries using microcontrollers. 

Our partner OEM manufacturer developed a gateway that is manufactured to the highest standards and represents all requirements outlined in HIP19. Our OEM manufacturer is the largest and highest quality producer of the LoRaWAN stack of devices and already has all local certification to sell in Russia, we are currently working with them on obtaining the CE mark as well for sale in Europe.

We also present a solution to an important challenge for the development of the Helium network in Russia — our gateway is manufactured locally, which shall be a legal requirement for the sale of any LoRaWAN gateway in Russia past 2022. 

Our vision is to extend Helium’s presence in Russia in a legal and compliant way and to extend supply for the ever-growing demand for Helium miners in Europe.

## Product Information (required)
At the moment, we already have a certified version of a stable and reliable gateway for the Russian market and we are ready to perform CE certification for the European markets in the near future:

Frequency range: 863-870 MHz (EU868, RU868)
Transmitter power: 500 mW (27 dBm)
LoRaWAN channels: 8

GPS: with built-in antenna
Uplink: Ethernet, 3G

Enclosure: Outdoor IP67
Operating temperature range: °С -40…+70

Antenna: 6 dBi

Power consumption: up to 10W
Type of power supply: Passive POE

We plan to launch this device as soon as possible in Russia and Europe. In parallel, we are developing light hotspot and plan to expand certification for the US market. After approving the application for the first version of our miner, we plan to inform the specification, forecast terms and cost of the lightweight solution.

## What is your approximate price point? (required)
Price: 650 Euros.

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)
To confirm the reality of the device, we will send a working sample of device for audit in accordance with the stages of the process.

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline? (required)
In the current conditions of shortage of electronic components, we are ready to fulfill orders in batches of 3 thousand devices. The production of one batch will take 6 months from the moment of the formation of the batch by receiving pre-orders. The delivery time of ready-made devices in Russia and in Europe will not exceed 2-3 weeks.

## Previous shipments (required)
Our company has not previously shipped HNT miners.

## Customer Support (required)
We are ready to provide support and advice to all our clients at the highest level. The standard warranty period of our products is 3 years, offered by our manufacturer.
We are focused on the production of the best quality products and build our customer service so that your business develops quickly, stably and reliably.

## Hardware Security Element (required)
Our base station is equipped with an ECC608 chip, and we also encrypt the firmware and system partitions of the OS. We also plan to improve the security of our technologies in the next versions of hotspots.

## Hardware Information (required)
* ECC608 
* SX1302/8 

## Manufacturing Information (required)
Our contract manufacturer has been the best in Russia for the production of electronics since 2005, and production using LoRaWAN technology was started in 2016. We are ready to provide information about the status of membership in industrial communities privately. We plan to use production facilities for the production of 10 thousand miners per year. Our products already have the necessary certification for the Russian market and in the near future plans to make a CE certification.

## Proof of Identity
Ready to provide any required information to DeWi. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
We are ready to invest in the production of 3,000 to 10,000 devices, depending on the volume of demand in the target markets.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
The main challenge that we see is the development of a cheap light hotspot and its certification according to FCC standards. We are aimed at a serious reduction in the cost of the final device and will involve the best engineers for this task. Equally important for us are the risks of supply chain issues and interaction with the community. We plan to consistently build the process of managing expectations and closely monitor each stage of the project in terms of timing and quality.
