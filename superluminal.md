## Superluminal Inc
Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19

## Summary
We are a group of partner companies operating in the USA, Germany and Russia. Our company mission is to develop the best IOT technologies and provide top tier customer service. In the next six months after the approval of the application, we plan to manufacture and deliver Full Hotspot fully compliant with the requirements of Russian and European regulators. We are also working on the development of Light Hotspot for wide use around the world.

## Company Information (required)
Superluminal Inc was founded in 2019 and is based in the places of presence of our customers – Los-Angeles, Germany and Moscow. In the US and Germany, we are building out a service for asset tracking and cold chain management based on the Helium ecosystem. In Russia, we are concentrating resources on the development of software and devices in the oil and medical industries using microcontrollers.

Our Russian OEM manufacturer developed a gateway according to the highest standards and represents all requirements outlined in HIP19. The manufacturer is the largest and highest quality producer of LoRaWAN devices and is fully certified to sell in Russia. We are currently working with them on obtaining the CE mark as well for selling products in Europe.

Importantly, we present a solution to a challenge unique to the Russian market — manufacturing technology locally. Russian state regulations only allow locally manufactured LoRaWan gateways to be sold in Russia past 2022. This is a crucial challenge to consider for the success and expansion of the Helium network in Russia.

Our vision is to extend Helium’s presence in Russia in a legal and compliant way and to extend supply for the ever-growing demand for Helium miners in Europe.

## Product Information (required)
At the moment, we already have a certified version of a stable and reliable Full Hotspot outdoor gateway for the Russian market and we are ready to perform CE certification for the European markets in the next two months after approval of our proposal:

CPU: Raspberry Pi 4 performance
RAM: 2 GB
Security element: ECC608
Radio: SX1302/8
Frequency range: 863-870 MHz (EU868, RU868)
Transmitter power: 500 mW (27 dBm)
LoRaWAN channels: 8
GPS: with built-in antenna
Backhaul: Ethernet, 3G
Enclosure: Outdoor IP67
Operating temperature range: °С -40…+70
Antenna: 4 dBi (6 dBi optional)
Power consumption: up to 10W
Type of power supply: Passive POE

We plan to launch this device as soon as possible in Russia and Europe. In parallel, we are developing a Light hotspot and plan to expand certification for the US market. After approving the application for the first version of our miner, we plan to inform the specification, forecast terms and cost of the lightweight solution.

## What is your approximate price point? (required)
Price: 650 Euros.

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)
To confirm the reality of the device, we will send a working sample of device for audit in accordance with the stages of the process.

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline? (required)
In the current conditions of shortage of electronic components, we are ready to fulfill orders in batches of 3 thousand devices. The production of one batch will take 6 months from the moment of the formation of the batch by receiving pre-orders. The delivery time of ready-made devices in Russia and in Europe will not exceed 2-3 weeks.

## Previous shipments (required)
Our company has not previously shipped HNT miners.

## Customer Support (required)
We are ready to provide top notch support and offer the highest quality customer service for our customers. The standard warranty period of our products is 3 years, offered by our manufacturer. Our focus lies in producing the best quality products and enabling the customers to grow their businesses in a scalable and reliable way.

## Hardware Security Element (required)
Our base station is equipped with an ECC608 chip, in addition we also encrypt the firmware and system partitions of the OS. We plan to constantly improve security and issue updates in the following versions of hotspots.

## Hardware Information (required)
* CPU: Raspberry Pi 4 performance
* RAM: 2 GB
* Security element: ECC608

## Manufacturing Information (required)
Our contract manufacturer has been the best in Russia for the production of electronics since 2005, and production using LoRaWAN technology was started in 2016. We are ready to provide information about the status of membership in industrial communities privately. We plan to use production facilities for the production of 10 thousand miners per year. Our products already have the necessary certification for the Russian market and in the near future plans to make a CE certification.

## Proof of Identity
Ready to provide any required information to DeWi. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
We are ready to invest in the production of 3,000 to 10,000 devices, depending on the volume of demand in the target markets.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
The main challenge that we see is the development of a cheap light hotspot and its certification according to FCC standards. We are aimed at a serious reduction in the cost of the final device and will involve the best engineers for this task. Equally important for us are the risks of supply chain issues and interaction with the community. We plan to consistently build the process of managing expectations and closely monitor each stage of the project in terms of timing and quality.
