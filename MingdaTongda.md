about 2,000 per month.
## Proof of Identity:
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives.

* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) 
we plan to produce about 1000 per lot ,and then arrange the next lot when there are less than 100 in stock. So we will carefully arrange the production to prevent budget overruns. 
## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
1. COVID-19 occurs and the city and factory are locked-down. We will use the online tools to organize our production.
2. the components are not in stock. We will carefully select components and mudules which are available in abundance， and place and order in advance.
3. the shippment are slowed. We will try our best to reduce our product's weight and valume, so we can ship the product by air.
