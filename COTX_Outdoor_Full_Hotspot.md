Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19

## Summary

Glad to be HIP19 again!

COTX Networks offers carrier-grade IoT management-platform and all-in-one IoT solutions. With competitive supply chain and strong R&D team, COTX designs and manufactures ranges of innovative, high-performance IoT gateways. Its first model indoor Hotspot COTX-X3 has been integrated to Helium Network successfully. Considering outdoor Hotspot is needed to make Helium network’s deployment more effective, we designed another full Hotspot for outdoor use, its model name is COTX-X5.

## What is your approximate price point? 

Our outdoor Hotspot X5 price range is between 539-579usd according to the order quantity.

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts

Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. 
This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline?

Lead time for bulk order will be 6-8weeks.

## Previous shipments

We shipped a lot of Petfon Trackers(www.petfon.com) which is a hot-selling product on Amazon US station to USA market.
We have also shipped bulk order to Europe market.

## Startups welcome! 

We have shipped indoor Hotspot to Europe including countries of Romania, UK, Turkey, Germany, Spain, Bulgium, Bulgaria, Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland.

About repairs and replacements within warranty period of 1year:

If the device is defective due to our manufacturing process shipping/mishandling on our part we will immediately offer a new replacement free of charge.

If the device/one of modules is defective due to user mishandling/error we could repair or arrange ship-out a replacement part at a reasonable price. This includes case, raspberry pi motherboard, power supply and antenna. 


## Hardware Security Element

Currently we are planning the following:

* Our X5 full Hotspot gateways will store their swarm_key on an ECC chip as requested. In the case of operating system got corrupted, that the user could recover their miner easily.
* We will be more than happy to submit prototypes for audit. For future products we are consistently evaluating more options including other security element chips.

## Hardware Information

* The mainboard is Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4B and LoRa module processor is SX1302&SX1303.
* WE are using ECC608 (swarm) chip for security element.
* We are using components of Semtech、Qualcomm、Skyworks、Microchip、AVAGO、TI、MTK、Winbond、Sliconlabs、ST、Muruta, and sourcing from franchised channels including Arrow Electronics，WT Microelectronics，Avnet，Cecport.
* We can procure from Semtech 200k-300k SX1302 chipset in 2021.

## Manufacturing Information

COTX Networks invested significantly in R&D and launches numerous gateways each year for various projects including applications of smart street, smart computer room, national museum, smart greenhouse. Those include hardware of LoRaWAN indoor gateway, outdoor gateway, AIOT edge gateway, integrated gateway etc. We are the main hardware& platform supplier of TOPSEC, SHUZHI.AI, TST, well known brands in China. What is more, as an OEM/ODM manufacturer, we have already produced over 50,000 sets LoRa trackers to Petfon in high quality, and 10,000 EUR standard indoor full Hotspot has been finished and ready to ship by the end of September,2021.

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately to DeWi. We have finished KYC by first time application for our indoor Hotspot.

## Budget & Capital

We aim to produce 5000-10000pcs X5 Miner hotspots as our first batch, then steadily provide 10000 units each month. COTX have sufficient funds to produce large volumes. For our existing indoor X3 model, our supply chain and production line have provided sufficient capacity and have large surplus. 

## Risks & Challenges 

The greatest challenge in our opinion is that the supply chain of SX1302&SX1303 with price volatility currently. We will solve it with a rich running stock, extra 10000 pieces chipsets or even more will arrive for stable materials supply.
