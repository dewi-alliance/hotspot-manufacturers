# SONoC-The third-Party Manufacturers

## SONoC Corp.

Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19. The submission of a HIP19 application does not guarantee approval. All questions must be answered, any missing information will result in delays.

## Summary

**SONoC is a startup firm focused on international business and IoT development. From 2021 till now, SONoC work hard to expand the coverage of Helium LoRaWAN network. In East Asia including Taiwan and Japan, SONoC work as a distributor for RAK and SenseCap to sell AS923 hotspot. We have shipped more than 5000 pcs of hotspots. SONoC now has a large number of helium users and active communities.**

**With the enormous opportunity of light hotspot, SONoC setup a strategic partnership with H2go corp (https://www.h2goapp.com/). H2go will integrate the SONoC's light hotspot inside the smart water dispenser. With this integration of helium light hotspot, our smart water dispenser can collect IoT datas such as water consumption, drinking habbit of different age groups including male vs. females. And furthermore, with the help of the water dispenser, the Helium LoRaWAN hotspot could acceess into millions of familly, which will be a great promotion for Helium network coverage. It is estimated that there would be more than 10k pcs of light hotspots could be installed with the sales of water dispenser in the San Francisco Bayarea alone.**

**Therefore SONoC is applying to become the manufacturer and vendor of the Helium light hotspot. We believe that we could provide series of  production with much more competiable price and higher quality. With the IoT solution of water dispenser landing, a newer and better LPWAN network, SONoC can do more contributions for Helium ecology.**

    - **ECC608 encryption chip for storage of swarm keys**
    - **Wi-Fi: IEEE802.11b/g/n/ac**
    - **Bluetooth: BT V4.2**
    - **Ethernet backhaul with RJ45**
    - **Frequency band: 470MHz/868MHz/915MHz/923MHz**
    - **DC5-DC12 supply**
    - **Small Size:108 * 120 * 26mm**
    - **IP40 for Indoor**
- What is your approximate price point?
  - **$129~$199. We try our best to provide an attractive price  for Helium Ecosystym and customer.**
- What is your expected production and delivery timeline?
