Guardian E&G Co., Ltd.

Guardian E&G Co., Ltd. is a specialized IT convergence company combining electric / electronic and wireless communication technologies.
We have applied loT technology to existing road lighting (streetlight / security, etc.) and applied it to the smart grid (wireless remote lighting and energy control system), water grid (unmanned water meter reading system) , Disabled people, poor people, etc.) into one system, we are taking a step forward in enhancing the lives of the people through the "ONE-STOP Happy Safety System" Hanaro.
The Guardian wireless networking network, which was created by the Unimo and International Electronics technicians who produced the police station radio and VHF unidirectional wireless communication, is a powerful wireless communication network based on wide-area multi-party communication. It is able to transmit reliable information securely It is also possible to implement various additional services by building an "open" wireless network that can be used by third parties.
We will make every effort to provide more convenient services.
Thank you.

•	What brought you to the Helium Network?
From 2017, we Started the LoRa gateway construction project. Received technology transfer from LoRa gateway developer called SETALAB.
Currently, LoRa gateways are being built throughout the local government of Daegu Metropolitan City in Korea.
The reasons for introducing a helium network are as follows.
1.	In Korea, the government-centered LoRa gateway construction has been progressing. Therefore, there were difficulties in securing a budget and selecting a site.
2.	For the epoch-making expansion of LoRa gateway construction, it was determined that the method through the helium network was the most effective.
3.	I was interested in the complex solution method of the existing government LoRa gateway and helium network method, so I participated.

Hardware Security Element (required)
•	The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email Dewi (christina@dewi.org).

**•	Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No?**
Yes (ECC608-TNGHNT )

**•	Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or No?**
Yes

**•	Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?**
We will be using ECC608 for the device (Yes)

**•	Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?**
 As I understand it, if you mean the way to protect the angular source code inside the device, then we will strengthen the external security of the device case.
 
**•	Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?**
Yes

Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 

(This prototype single board is a type that does not contain ECC608 chip yet.)

**•	What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?**
The basic software setup will be configured through the helium official app, and additionally we will use a commercial remote control service for maintenance

**•	Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using?**
 ECC608-TNGHNT
 
**•	Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs.)**
SX1303(RAK 5146)
