## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email the Helium Foundation (christina@helium.foundation).
* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No?
  **Yes**
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or No? 
  **Yes**
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
  **Yes**
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No? (Please note, the final design will be audited against this statement. Do not answer 'yes' unless the design will have these features and a description of where they are implemented can be provided.)
  **We will be utilizing a tamper switch. The tamper switch is planned to be placed to prevent opening the enclosure of the device by unauthorized persons.**
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
  **Yes**

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?
  **- Wi-Fi Connectivity (For OTA)**
  **- Bluetooth Connectivity**
  **- High Precision GNSS**
  **- 100/1000Mbps Ethernet Support**

This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? 
  **ECC608 Security Module**
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs.) 
  **SX1302/SX1303 LoRa Transceiver**
* What is the CPU?
  **NXP i.MX6 Series CPU (1x Cortex-A9 @1.2GHz or 2x Cortex-A9 @1.2GHz)**
* Other Hardware Specifications: 
  **256MB DDR3 RAM / 8GB eMMC**

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
  **Yes**
* Have you built gateways before? 
  **Yes**
* How many gateways did you make? 
  **~1500**
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer or working with a partner? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
  
* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
  **We working relationship with distributors of major chipset providers, and we also have direct channels where we are able to procure our components from the providers themselves**
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?
  **50,000** 

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or Helium Foundation board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives.
Details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales? 
  **15,000**
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
  **We are planning to initially invest $750,000 and gradually increase. We have more than double this amount to cover for all our production pipeline.**
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) 
  **We are a well-funded and revenue-generating company and work with the largest automotive and robotics companies in the world. We are not only generating our revenue from the hardware sales but also from the software we sell.**

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
  **The biggest challenge in the current environment is the supply of materials. To address this, we trust our proven capabilities in hardware design and firmware development. We are not dependent on a specific module (especially in terms of CPU, RAM, Flash memory) which creates stock issues and causes higher lead times for manufacturers.**
