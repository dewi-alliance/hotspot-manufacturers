## What is your approximate price point? (required)

***Price Range from 700-900 US dollars base on order quantities***

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. 
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.

***Our production takes 8-12 weeks, and delivery takes 6-13 days by air or 29-33 days by sea.***
## Startups welcome! 
* Have you shipped anything in the past? ***Yes***
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products?  
***We have MS-WUP-310 Wireless Universal Port Controller, MSCN-160  Wireless Lighting Controller, MS-GW-150 shipped from China to Canada. They are all FCC, DLC, cULus Certified.***

* Which countries do you plan to ship to? 
***We plan on shipping to the US, Canada, Philippine and all countries in Europe and Middle East***
## Customer Support (required)
* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products? 
***We are a company based in Canada. Customers are welcome to contact us by phone, email or in person.
We also provide support via Helium Discord Channel. ***

* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 
***We provide a one year warranty for the product. We will provide repair service remotely or when the customer ships the product back to us within warranty.***

## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. ***Yes***
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. ***Yes***
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. ***No***
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) ***Yes***

## Hardware Information (required)
* Please let us know:

* Which security (swarm) element are you using? 
***We use the software to encrypt the swarm_key to the hard drive. Each device will have a unique key. The encryption process itself is protected by VIRBOX PROTECTOR.***

* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs 

***We use SX1302 & SX1250***

* Where are you sourcing your components from? 

***We source our component from the following distributors:***
***Mouser.ca***
***Address:***
***137 Glasgow Street***
***Unit 475 A***
***Kitchener, Ontario N2G 4X8***
***Canada***
***Digikey.ca***
***Arrow.com***
***Futureelectronics.com***
***Our China contractor manufacturer DUSUN Electron LTD has its own supply chain as well***

* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 
***10,000/year***

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
***Yes, Our wireless lighting controller model MSCN-160, Wireless universal port controller model MSWUP-310 all use radio hardware for IOT networks.***

* Have you built gateways before? 
***Yes, our Wireless Gateway MS-GW-150 communicates with controllers and devices via wireless full mesh network for a wireless network up to 500 nodes. The gateway actively controls and monitors the lighting fixtures and manages the scheduling, grouping, energy metering, and sensor behaviours. The gateway allows local control without the internet/cloud server connectivity.***
* How many gateways did you make? 
***8000 pcs*** 
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? ***We are planning to make and sell 20,000/year, Omnisolu Technology Inc. has sufficient funds to produce large volumes, our supply chain and production line have provided sufficient capacity and have large surplus.***
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
***Our challenges at the current stage are the global supply chain restraints. There is lack of the chips and other parts. But with years of experience in the intelligent and wireless control manufacturing industry, we are confident that our connections in the related field will help us conquer this.***
