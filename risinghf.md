RHF2S027 is an industrial-grade LoRaWAN gateway series carefully built by RiSingHF with support for full-duplex mode. Embedded Linux operating system and the main control chip are the powerful Arm® Cortex®-A7 platform, with a main frequency of up to 800MHz. Built-in Semtech high-performance multi-channel LoRa transceiver SX1302. This gateway can be connected to the LoRaWAN cloud server through the Ethernet network. The internal GPS module can provide high-precision PPS signals for Device clock synchronization and geographic location acquisition. This gateway is embedded with a web configuration client, which can be connected to the gateway through wifi to realize rapid configuration and maintenance, which is convenient for on-site installation and fault diagnosis. This gateway supports USB adapter power supply, simple and convenient.

RHF2S027 uses a self-developed application to remotely upgrade the device, and set up and configure wifi through local software web interface


What is your expected production and delivery timeline? (required)

--Our delivery time can be March 2022 once getting HW audit certificate.

Previous shipments (required)--NO

Startups welcome!

- Have you shipped anything in the past? Yes or No
  --yes
- Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 
  --Europe and North America, china
- Which countries do you plan to ship to? 
  --Europe and North America, china

Customer Support (required)

- How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products? 
  --email, support@risinghf.com
- For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 
  --Our FAE team provide support 7x24h

Hardware Security Element (required)

- The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:
- Are you using an ECC608. Yes or no? 
  -- Yes
- Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? 
  --Yes
- Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
  -- Yes
- Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?
  --- Yes
- Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
  --Yes

Hardware Information (required)

- Please let us know:
- Which security (swarm) element are you using? 
  -- ECC608
- Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 
  --- We use SX1302/03 & SX1250 
- Where are you sourcing your components from? 
  ---from Semtech and other IC suppliers
- How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 
  --- 10K per month

Manufacturing Information (required)

- Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
  --yes
- Have you built gateways before? 
  --Yes
- How many gateways did you make? 
  --10k per year
- If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.---We manufacture by RiSingHF ourself

Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.

Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

Budget & Capital (required)

- How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
  -- 10k per month
- How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
  --10 Million Dollars on hand
- What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures - getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 
  --We have investors who can invest us more once it is necessary

Risks & Challenges (required)

Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them. 
--Nowadays IC supply chain is a challenge for us and we will handle with them
