  --RHF2S027 is an industrial-grade LoRaWAN gateway series carefully built by RiSingHF with support for half-duplex mode. Embedded Linux operating system and the main control chip are the powerful STM32MP151A platform, with a main frequency of up to 650MHz. Built-in Semtech high-performance multi-channel LoRa transceiver SX1302. This gateway can be connected to the LoRaWAN cloud server through the Ethernet network. The internal GPS module can provide high-precision PPS signals for
  Device clock synchronization and geographic location acquisition.
  This gateway is embedded with a web configuration client, which can be connected to the gateway through wifi to realize rapid configuration and maintenance, which is convenient for on-site installation and fault diagnosis. This gateway supports USB adapter power supply, simple and convenient.

- Are you using an ECC608. Yes or no? 
  -- Yes
- Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? 
  --Yes
- Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
  -- Yes
- Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?
  --- Yes
- Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
  --Yes

Hardware Information (required)

- Please let us know:
- Which security (swarm) element are you using? 
  -- ECC608
- Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 
  --- We use SX1302
- Where are you sourcing your components from? 
  ---from Semtech and other IC suppliers
- How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 
  --- 10K per month

Manufacturing Information (required)
- Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
  --yes
- Have you built gateways before? 
  --Yes
- How many gateways did you make? 
  --10k per year
- If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
  ---We manufacture by RiSingHF ourself

Proof of Identity
Ready to provide any required information to DeWi 

Budget & Capital (required)
