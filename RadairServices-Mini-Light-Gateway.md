Manufacturing Information
 
Radair’s engineering team has experience building communication devices for over 20 years with Panasonic Avionics and other top companies, and have manufacturered a smart 4G LTE mPCIe Smart Communications module.
 
This is the first Gateway by Radair
We have not yet manufactured the Gateways
 
We are using a reputable manufacturer with over 10 years of experience producing LoRaWan gateways.  All designs have been vetted by three independent experienced groups.
 
Calchip, Semtech, Microchip Technologies, Espressif, Seeed, Avnet, Mouser, Allwinner, Bosch and Qualcomm
 
Radair already has over 20K SX1302/3, over 40K SX1250s and over 20K ATECC608B to ensure production levels in 2022
 
Radair Services Inc.  is currently a privately-held company.  Officers and ownership will be submitted directly to Helium.
 
## Budget & Capital
 
Radair intends to manufacture 20K + Hotspots in the first six months.
Radair estimates that approximately US$5M is required. Radair is sufficiently capitalized for this budget, and has already procured the primary chipsets.  Additional financing requirements are unlikely.
 
## Risks & Challenges
 
Risks include the current chip shortage, certification requirements, and time for approval and testing with the Helium Foundation.   Radair is addressing this by staying very close with its supply chain, purchasing high demand chips early, and keeping open lines of communication with Helium.  Radair is also able to act quickly by having engineering and programming resources in-house.
