## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or no?

    Yes

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? 
    
    Yes

* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?

    Yes

* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?

    No

* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?

    Yes

## Hardware Information (required)
* The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email DeWi (christina@dewi.org).

    ECC608

* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using?

    ECC608

* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs

    SX1302 & SX1250s

* What is the CPU?

    1.35GHZ 64 bit dual-core ARM Cortex-A53

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
    
    Yes: Zigbee, Wifi, WiHD, and WiGig

* Have you built gateways before? 

    Yes

* How many gateways did you make? 
    
    \>10,000

* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

* Where are you sourcing your components from?

    Sourcing for components will be done globally by our selected contract manufacturer utilizing their powerful supply chain and supporting help from our Engineering team.

* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?
    
    50,000 annually ramp up to 200,000

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales? 

    We forecast to make and sell 50,000 hotspots in the year of 2022. 

* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
    
    $500K for product development and $2M to start shipping first SKUs

* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures - getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) 
    
    There is little concern as we will be backed by  government loans and grants for exporting goods. 

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.

Supply chain is the immediate risk and we have already started negotiations through our CM. For longer term cost reduction is the risk and we have few plans on Engineering cost reduction as well as longer term negotiations with suppliers.
