## Peplink - MAX BR1 IP55

## Summary

In the modern world, connectivity is indispensable. Here at Peplink we developed proprietary technologies (e.g. SpeedFusion, SpeedFusion Cloud, FusionSIM) which we placed into our products and services to make connectivity reliable at any conditions.

Using our technologies, we have developed a wide range of products and services. Our products include wired, wireless, and virtual routers for networks of every size and environment. While they vary in capacity, features, and form factor, they are all built for one simple goal: to make connectivity reliable.

We also have a full range of supporting products such as network switches, wireless antennas and access points to help customers seamlessly build and manage their network from HQ to branch to remote edge, all under one roof.

Our products and services form an ecosystem that provides new functionality while simplifying network management. Users can build flexible multi-site networks within minutes and track any cellular router’s route history on a GPS map. They can also apply network-wide scheduling for Wi-Fi radios, captive portals, switch port states and firmware updates.

The other end of the equation is the Community ecosystem, with the Peplink Forum at the heart. This is where Peplink’s R&D team, channel partners and end users interact and support each other, and where new ideas for product features emerge. Our team picks up on these ideas and refines them into new features and improvements.

Our community and product ecosystems become a positive feedback loop that results in enhanced product features, improved user experience, and brings in more users into our ecosystem.

## Previous shipments
Peplink has more than 15 years of experience in designing and shipping products to worldwide clients and partners.

## Which countries do you plan to ship to and get regulatory certifications for? (required)
US, Canada and European Union. Certification will include FCC, IC, CE, PTCRB and other carrier related certification for the LTE version.

## Customer Support
Peplink has an issues reporting system for all of their clients. There is no limit for how long support issues can be reported. Replacement handling will be done as for any other Peplink RMA case (more details: https://www.peplink.com/support/policies/)

## Hardware Security Element
We plan to use the ECC608 IC (ATECC608A).

In addition we also use Peplink related security measures to address any SW or sensitive information related copying (Firmware encryption, additional security chipset dedicated for Firmware only, etc).

## Hardware Information

We plan to reuse the existing product (BR1 IP55) for this project.
Here is all HW related information:  https://www.peplink.com/products/max-single-cellular-br1-ip-55-router/

The current product version is missing a LoRaWAN radio and security chip (ECC608) dedicated to Helium. To verify a proof of concept an in-house data-only hotspot was made by adding missing parts (LoRa radio and security chip). The prototype was successfully registered in the Helium network. Our Hotspot name is “Tart Rosewood Copperhead”. 

## Manufacturing Information
Peplink has more than 15 years of experience in designing and manufacturing radio hardware products. We keep the design in-house while all the production is outsourced so that we could focus on what we are best at - engineering and problem solving. We work with many contract manufacturers who can match our quality standards and we have long experience in managing production. This helps us to get the best possible speeds and virtually no limitation on production capacity.

We started LoRaWAN development about 1-1.5 year ago. For more than a half year we have conducted field testing to verify SW and HW reliability. Helium is a next step to enhance our LoRaWAN solution.

## Risks & Challenges
The main Risks & Challenges are related to the IC shortage, which has been unpredictable and hard to manage for the past year and this probably will continue to be challenging for another 1-2 years. To minimize risks we plan working with several Contract Manufacturers allowing us to minimize risks during these hard times.
