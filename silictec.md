Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. 
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 
We have our independent software technique team, they are all-time standing-by and would make regular updating. 

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline? (required)
Depends on the Marketing and Helium Official. 

## Previous shipments (required)

## Startups welcome! 
* Have you shipped anything in the past? Yes
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 
Globally.

## Which countries do you plan to ship to and get regulatory certifications for? (required)
Depends on the Market.

## Customer Support (required)
* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products? Online. 
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 
Hardware replacement depends on the logistics time. Software can be fixed online immediately.  


## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or no? NO.
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? NO.
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No? No.
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?No.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?No.
* 
## Hardware Information (required)
* The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email DeWi (christina@dewi.org). Which security (swarm) element are you using? SX1302/03
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) SX1302/03
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs 
* Where are you sourcing your components from? China and globally
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? We procure all modules, but the delivery time is changing according to the market. 

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?Yes.
* Have you built gateways before? Yes.
* How many gateways did you make? Routers, Wi-Fi mesh.
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Proof of Identity:
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 4000 pieces per quater 
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? Silictec (Shenzhen) is not a newly stablished company and we have mature production and marketing lines, we have stable company profit income so we don't have any problem about the upfront fundation. 
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures - getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 
* 
## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
The delivery time of some modules is always changing. Presale according to the delivery time should be the solution.
