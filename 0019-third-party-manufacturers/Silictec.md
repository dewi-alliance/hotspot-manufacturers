* How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? Repairs in 1 year and replacements in half a year. 


## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email Dewi (christina@dewi.org).  Yes, ECC608
* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No? Yes. 
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or No? Yes.
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No? Yes. 
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No? Yes. 
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No? Yes.

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or our developed app.  Software can be updated OTA, also can connect with the official app with WiFI
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? ECC608
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs.) SX1302
* What is the CPU? Cortex.
* Other Hardware Specifications: Undetermined. 

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? Yes.
* Have you built gateways before? Yes.
* How many gateways did you make? 10 Thousand.
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain. We have our own manufacturer. 
* Where are you sourcing your components from? China mainland and Taiwan.
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 10000 for a year.

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives.
Details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales? 5000 
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? Silictec (Shenzhen) is not a newly stablished company and we have mature production and marketing lines, we have stable company profit income so we don't have any problem about the upfront foundation.
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) We have our own investors and organizations, and we also benefits from our other products. 


## Risks & Challenges (required)
