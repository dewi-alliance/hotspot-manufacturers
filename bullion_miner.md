## Hardware Information (required). Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 

- Raspberry Pi 4B (2G or above)
- Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz 
- dual-band 802.11ac\n wireless 2.4GHz/5GHz
- Gigabit Ethernet
- Bluetooth 5.0
- Lora SX1302 LoRaWAN / SX1250
- ECC608 Security 
- Antenna 4dbi Enhanced to include 2dbi

* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. Mobile/PC to connect miner through bluetooth with app to update wifi setting and remote updates
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? ECC608
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? SX1302
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs. 
* What is the CPU? Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz 
* Other Hardware Specifications: SX1302 LoRA HAT x1 (SPI&I2C, 8 channels)

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? Bullion Miner Limited have not yet as we are a new start-up company.
* Have you built gateways before? Our team have extensive experience with which to handle development and production of the product.
* How many gateways did you make? None at present.
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain. We have design ownership of the product and hold the manufacturing licence but we outsource the manufacturing to a 3rd party supplier with a great deal of experience, capability and capacity. Our core components are to be supplied by EdaTec, who are a highly experienced LoraWAN gateway Helium hotspot manufacturer for multiple existing brands offering us excellent support, and with access to ongoing high volume supplies. We will also be utilising Melent, in order to build the devices, who's team are also extremely experienced with radio and electronic component design and manufacture. 
* Where are you sourcing your components from? Avnet, RS-online and other authorized suppliers.
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? We have full confidence in our main supplier, with many tens of thousands in stock with a maximum two week lead time to our factory. Capacity will be thousands of units per month. We have back up suppliers also.

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales? 600 (We plan for 100 per month for the first 6 months, dependent on supply and demand plan to increase accordingly)
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? The business has access to sufficient and ongoing funds to ensure development and manufacturing throughout 2022. 
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) The business owners have other lucrative business ventures which guarantee ongoing access to funds along with contingency to release funds from elsewhere.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them. Whilst the global chip shortage presents a challenge, we do however have a very good relationship with the supply chains in China and short lead times ensuring the amount ordered.
