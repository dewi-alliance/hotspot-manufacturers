## Customer Support ##

Bobcat can provide customer support via:

* Discordâ€™s Vendor channel
* 7 * 24 hours customer enquiry
* FAQ section for customer to search the answers of their issues.
* The hardware maintenance service will be one year free for labor cost, provided hardware replacement if the breakdown of hardware comes from itself.
* The software issues could be solved by SSH remote access or OTA upgrade.

## Hardware Security ##

Currently we use ATECC608 encryption chip for swarm key storage, and key is securely provisioned during manufacturing.

## Manufacturing Information ##

We have long-standing business cooperation with a number of trusted manufacturing partners and have successfully delivered multiple major projects in the past 5 years including Alibaba LoRaWAN City Coverage for Hangzhou, 300Ku LoRaWAN Water Meter projects in China and 30Ku LoRaWAN Electricity Meter Projects for Indonesia. We will continue using these manufacturers for producing Helium Hotspot Miner and Helium Light Gateway.

## Proof of Identity

Separately submitted to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital

Based on the current estimate and market insight, Bobcat intends to produce 20Ku per month in 2021 and allows production flexibility as customer demand requires.

Due to the necessity of components readiness for manufacturing gateway products, Bobcat should balance cash flow and reserve a minimum US$1M as the budget for supply chain. 

## Risks & Challenges

Since our factories are all in mainland China, there may be possible delay in transportation and maintenance of our products. We are planning to establish cooperation with international courier service should the proposal goes well.

Another thing to concern is the scale of our customer service with the growth of the network. More resource will be deployed.
