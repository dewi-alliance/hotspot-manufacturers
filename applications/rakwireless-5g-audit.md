## Shenzhen RAKwireless Technology Co., Ltd. 

### HIP19 Amendment for 5G Gateway

## Summary

At [RAKwireless](https://www.rakwireless.com), our mission is to enable entrepreneurs and enthusiasts to develop innovative products by creating and supplying breakthrough Internet of Things (IoT) technology and services to the market. We offer complete IoT solutions, including end-node sensors, gateways, and cloud computing. We work together with major ecosystems and produce a rapidly expanding pipeline of products at scale. 

In 2021, RAKwireless launched [MNTD.](https://www.getmntd.com), a consumer-friendly brand focused on making crypto-hardware accessible to everyday people. RAKwireless is the same company that built the original Helium hotspot and remains one of the most trusted manufacturers in the ecosystem with over 300k RAK and MNTD. hotspots shipped across Northern America and Europe. 

Fast forward to 2022, Helium 5G is here and MNTD. understands users' need and desire to upgrade their crypto mining hardware. With further investment in technology, we are now able to upgrade all existing MNTD. hotspots (and RAK hotspots with 4G RAM) to run 5G. When upgraded, hotspots will support 5G while retaining their LoRaWAN® capabilities, as well as earn both IOT and MOBILE tokens. 

In this HIP19 Amendments we update RAK 5G Gateway information for audit.

## Company Information

**Shenzhen RAKwireless Technology Co., Ltd.** was established in June 2014. It is based in Shenzhen, China with an office in Beijing. Our collaborators span the planet from Asia (India, Philippines, Taiwan), Europe (Bulgaria, Portugal and UK) and the Americas (U.S.A., Colombia and Brazil) 

We are an industry-leading full stack infrastructure and solution provider for wireless networks spanning across hardware and software from the edge to the core. Under our motto “**IoT Made Easy**” we offer the building blocks that allow our customers to deliver world class products and services.

## Product Information

Our main product areas are in IoT modules, LoRa gateways and node devices. Now, we expand the product to Wide Band Wireless technology like 5G and WiFi. We have over 50 products currently in active production. Please consult [RAKwireless products](https://www.rakwireless.com/en-us/products) for the full list. 

RAKwireless has manufactured and shipped over one million devices including over 300k LoRa gateways. Amongst those are the original Helium Hotspot as well as our own current RAK Hotspot Miner. 

We have collaborated with Helium from very early stage. Please see : [Why we believe helium was right form the very beginning](https://news.rakwireless.com/why-we-believe-helium-was-right-from-the-very-beginning/) .

Our current Helium product is the **RAK Hotspot Miner**, now counting over 300k units active on the network. We set up consumer brand [MNTD.](https://www.getmntd.com) originally retailing at $419 for Blackspot and $519 for Goldspot. The difference between a Goldspot and a Blackspot is that Goldspots are limited edition and come with double (8GB) the RAM.

To help existing users mine 5G on helium Network, we are able to upgrade the existing Hotspot(with 4GB or more RAM version) to support 5G. We have the following upgrades:

- We will bundle with an **MNTD. 5G Upgrade Kit** to enable 5G Function. 
- We will keep LoRa based LongFi mining function and install with full miner. We also support future network upgrades such as Light Hotspot client transition.

The **MNTD. 5G Upgrade Kit** will retail for $300~400, including 5G software upgrade fee, new TF card fee, $50 5G onboarding fee and around $60 per year CBRS frequency usage fee.

The product uses the existing **MNTD app** for configuration

We also work on the [MNTD.5G](https://getmntd.com/5g/) which is first **Everything-in-One Hotspot** for Helium Network 

We expect enable the upgrade in Aug,2022, meanwhile, we also allow user to purchase the new **MNTD. Goldspot 5G** and **MNTD. Blackspot 5G** with 5G enabled natively from our [MNTD.](https://www.getmntd.com) website, originally retail for $600~$700.

## Manufacturing Information

##### Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?

We have been building LoRaWAN Hotspot for many years including the first third party hotspots on the Helium network and we partner with **Baicells** to deliver the 5G Radio hardware

##### Have you built gateways before? 

Yes

##### How many gateways did you make? 

More than 400k

##### If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third-party manufacturer or working with a partner? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

NA

## Budget & Capital

##### How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales?  

We are planning to upgrade the existing MNTD & RAk Hotspot Miner V2 hotspots to support 5G. Users only need to purchase an upgrade kit and 5G radios. We plan to produce 10k radios and 20k upgrade kits in the first six months.

##### How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to?

We estimated we need around 10 million USD up-front. We have enough capital in hand.

##### What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.)

We are backed by a leading venture company: Shunwei Capital and Cero Capital. We also are the leading IoT tech company in China and we have a strong finance system to manage the cash flow and supply chain.

## Risks & Challenges

The risks are:

1. How long the certification will take. Marketing requires to have an upgrade solution available as soon as possible.
2. Since HIP 53 is not approved, we are still waiting for implementation guidance to support 5G-related Oracle and service settlement.
