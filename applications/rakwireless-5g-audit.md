## Shenzhen RAKwireless Technology Co., Ltd. 

### HIP19 Amendment for 5G Gateway

## Summary

At [RAKwireless](https://www.rakwireless.com), our mission is to enable entrepreneurs and enthusiasts to develop innovative products by creating and supplying breakthrough Internet of Things (IoT) technology and services to the market. We offer complete IoT solutions, including end-node sensors, gateways, and cloud computing. We work together with major ecosystems and produce a rapidly expanding pipeline of products at scale. 

In 2021, RAKwireless launched [MNTD.](https://www.getmntd.com), a consumer-friendly brand focused on making crypto-hardware accessible to everyday people. RAKwireless is the same company that built the original Helium hotspot and remains one of the most trusted manufacturers in the ecosystem with over 300k RAK and MNTD. hotspots shipped across Northern America and Europe. 

Fast forward to 2022, Helium 5G is here and MNTD. understands users' need and desire to upgrade their crypto mining hardware. With further investment in technology, we are now able to upgrade all existing MNTD. hotspots (and RAK hotspots with 4G RAM) to run 5G. When upgraded, hotspots will support 5G while retaining their LoRaWAN® capabilities, as well as earn both IOT and MOBILE tokens. 

In this HIP19 Amendments we update RAK 5G Gateway information for audit.

## Company Information

**Shenzhen RAKwireless Technology Co., Ltd.** was established in June 2014. It is based in Shenzhen, China with an office in Beijing. Our collaborators span the planet from Asia (India, Philippines, Taiwan), Europe (Bulgaria, Portugal and UK) and the Americas (U.S.A., Colombia and Brazil) 

We are an industry-leading full stack infrastructure and solution provider for wireless networks spanning across hardware and software from the edge to the core. Under our motto “**IoT Made Easy**” we offer the building blocks that allow our customers to deliver world class products and services.

## Product Information

Our main product areas are in IoT modules, LoRa gateways and node devices. Now, we expand the product to Wide Band Wireless technology like 5G and WiFi. We have over 50 products currently in active production. Please consult [RAKwireless products](https://www.rakwireless.com/en-us/products) for the full list. 

RAKwireless has manufactured and shipped over one million devices including over 300k LoRa gateways. Amongst those are the original Helium Hotspot as well as our own current RAK Hotspot Miner. 

We have collaborated with Helium from very early stage. Please see : [Why we believe helium was right form the very beginning](https://news.rakwireless.com/why-we-believe-helium-was-right-from-the-very-beginning/) .

Our current Helium product is the **RAK Hotspot Miner**, now counting over 300k units active on the network. We set up consumer brand [MNTD.](https://www.getmntd.com) originally retailing at $419 for Blackspot and $519 for Goldspot. The difference between a Goldspot and a Blackspot is that Goldspots are limited edition and come with double (8GB) the RAM.

To help existing users mine 5G on helium Network, we are able to upgrade the existing Hotspot(with 4GB or more RAM version) to support 5G. We have the following upgrades:

- We will bundle with an **MNTD. 5G Upgrade Kit** to enable 5G Function. 
- We will keep LoRa based LongFi mining function and install with full miner. We also support future network upgrades such as Light Hotspot client transition.

The **MNTD. 5G Upgrade Kit** will retail for $300~400, including 5G software upgrade fee, new TF card fee, $50 5G onboarding fee and around $60 per year CBRS frequency usage fee.

The product uses the existing **MNTD app** for configuration

We also work on the [MNTD.5G](https://getmntd.com/5g/) which is first **Everything-in-One Hotspot** for Helium Network 

We expect enable the upgrade in Aug,2022, meanwhile, we also allow user to purchase the new **MNTD. Goldspot 5G** and **MNTD. Blackspot 5G** with 5G enabled natively from our [MNTD.](https://www.getmntd.com) website, originally retail for $600~$700.
