# **Name**

E-sun Electronics Ltd/ Panther X2

 

# **Summary**

E-sun Electronics understands the importance of a paradigm shift for decentralized wireless infrastructure powered by the Helium Blockchain. Therefore, we are delighted to become a third-party manufacturer and build a high-efficiency regular hotspot (Panther X). Shortly, we aim to contribute to the connective grid for the helium network and develop and provide the tools and sensors to the business parties.

 

We are submitting a new proposal for the Panther X2 hotspot, an enhanced model of Panther X hotspots. We hand many orders for the Panther X Hotspot now and have received solid supports from the community. With all that help, we can acquire better components for the Panther X Hotspots.

**Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings via Helium's official app or otherwise.**

We will support the official Helium application.

 

# **Customer Support**

As we already ran our online store and established a perfect agent system, we can easily manage Customer's after-sale demand. We provide a 2-Year Warranty for our devices. European Customers can contact us via email, Discord, Twitter, Telegram, Instagram and the official website. We also have established Chinese Customer Support that is provided via WeChat, Discord and our official website. We plan on providing support and updates for the lifetime of the product. In addition, Panther will provide worldwide support and replacements or reverse logistics through our distribution network.

 

With the experience that we have established with the Panther X1 product, we can extend our support to more customers worldwide. The most important for Panther X Customer Support is to make every customer happy with their experience with Panther X Products.

 

We have a team to provide customers with comprehensive pre-sales consultation and after-sales service. The customer service centre includes the pre-sale consulting department, technical service department, and product maintenance department. The technical service department is responsible for solving technical problems that may arise, while the after-sales services focus on reporting, processing and fixing the technical issues raised by customers. The product maintenance department is responsible for product maintenance and order traceability.

 

# **Hardware Security**

We have adopted the ECC608 security element chip to increase the security of the swarm key.

 

# **Hardware Information**

**● Which security (swarm) element are you using?**

ATECC608A 

 

**● Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (i.e. SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)**

SX1302&SX1250 

 

**● Where are you sourcing your components from?**

Our components are sourced from all over the world, both online and offline. In addition, we have established good cooperation with several big suppliers who reserve enough components for us. 

 

# **Manufacturing Information**

BROWAN COMMUNICATIONS (referred to as Browan) is an essential partner of E-sun, responsible for the mass production of Panther X.

 

Browan is a professional wireless equipment company founded in 1999. The company is one of the Gemtek Group's (Taiwan listed company, stock code 4906) companies that focus on leveraging the wireless technology Know-How accumulated over the years to address the emerging businesses of the Internet of Things. In addition, BROWAN focuses on integrating wireless technology such as WiFi, BLE, LTE, and LoRa.

 

# **Proof of Identity**

We have submitted this information to Dewi via email in July.

 

# **Budget & Capital**

We have sufficient funding support to produce the hardware in large volumes. Therefore, we aim to build at least 10000 pcs every month.

 

# **Risks & Challenges**

Our customer orders are growing fast. We are expanding our assembly line per the demand growth. We firmly believe that the most significant risk may come from the shortage of related chips and various components. Therefore, enhancing and expanding our supply chain is the most crucial task in our industries.

 

The main risks and challenges are the supply of the components and assembly of the associated electronics, and the reliability of the shipping networks. 

 

Fortunately, the manufacturer we are working with has successfully used it many times before, and we know and trust they can deliver to schedule. As an established and busy e-commerce business, Panther X can easily handle the shipping burden of this project and have all the frameworks in place to achieve this quickly and efficiently. Whilst delays do unfortunately sometimes occur with shipping networks, these are relatively infrequent, and we will do our best to mitigate these at the time of shipping. We will be using well-known shipping companies for our shipping, and the shipping is fully insured and tracked around Mainland China and European Regions.
