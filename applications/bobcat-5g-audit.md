### HIP19 Amendment for 5G Gateway and Alternate Security Implementations

## Summary

[Easylinkin](www.easylinkin.net) is an Wide Area IoT solution provider with core competency in LoRaWAN Gateway Manufacturing and Module Design. 

We are currently one of the biggest manufaturers for Helium Hotspot Miner and provide gateway prototype for Helium Light Gateway and 5G Gateway.

In this HIP19 Amendments we updated 5G Gateway information for audit and proposed alternative TMP security model.

## Hardware Security ##

Currently we use TPM 2.0 in 5G gateway, and key is securely provisioned during manufacturing. TPM is the common, broadly used standard for storing security keys in x86 based hardware, and we'd like to extend security options for Helium ecosystem.

##### What is the key's security model?

We are using NPCT750 from Nuvoton, datasheet available in bobcat folder.

##### How/where is the key generated? 

Key is generated inside the TPM chip using Fapi_CreateKey command (refer to FAPI spec). Then it's encrypted with Primary TPM key which is unique for each TMP and is regenerated each time you reset the TPM chip. Then this encrypted blob is stored on external media. It is then possible to use generated key only inside this TPM module. Prior to use TPM loads it inside itself and decrypts. Decrypted key never leaves TPM chip.

##### What guarantees do we have about the key being extracted?

Primary key is unique for each TPM module, making it impossible to use blob with key on any other TPM module. The very purpose of TPM chip is to provide hardware based mechanism for securely storing the keys inside of the chip without the possibility of extraction. Impossibility of extraction is guaranteed by TPM spec. However user can either reset the whole TPM chip effectively erasing all the keys or remove individual keys using TPM commands directly.

##### What are your plans for software integration with Full Hotspot (miner) and Light Hotspot (gateway-rs) codebases?

Bobber 500 is curretnly running as a full hotspot. We'll update the light hotspot image according to Helium's plan.

## Manufacturing Information ##

We have long-standing business cooperation with a number of trusted manufacturing partners and have successfully delivered multiple major projects in the past 5 years including Alibaba LoRaWAN City Coverage for Hangzhou, 300Ku LoRaWAN Water Meter projects in China and 30Ku LoRaWAN Electricity Meter Projects for Indonesia. We will continue using these manufacturers for producing Helium Hotspot Miner and Helium Light Gateway.

## Proof of Identity

Separately submitted to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital

Based on the current estimate and market insight, Bobcat intends to produce 20Ku per month in 2021 and allows production flexibility as customer demand requires.

Due to the necessity of components readiness for manufacturing gateway products, Bobcat should balance cash flow and reserve a minimum US$1M as the budget for supply chain. 

## Risks & Challenges

Since our factories are all in mainland China, there may be possible delay in transportation and maintenance of our products. We are planning to establish cooperation with international courier service should the proposal goes well.

Another thing to concern is the scale of our customer service with the growth of the network. More resource will be deployed.
