## Manufacturing Information
Our trusted manufacturing partners in China have a complete mass production supply chain of Helium miners. We are capable of producing around 10,000 units per month now and will continue to increase our capacity. Upon approval, our team will be able to mobilize funds and start the mass production ASAP. The finished devices will be then transported to the US, waiting to be dispatched. Additional team members will be hired to support operation work. Our investors and technical expertise will assist us along the way, ensuring smooth production and transportation for the growing demand of Helium miners.

## Proof of Identity
To be submitted privately to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital
We intend to produce 10,000 units per month to meet the current demand and more after the first few batches. We have secured all the capital needed to bring the first batch to market.

## Risks & Challenges
In order to continue our production with our robust supply chain for Helium miners, we aim to secure the stock of critical components beforehand. Despite the remaining impact of a global pandemic such as shortage of chips, transportation delay, etc, We will get through the disturbances and scale production to meet the growing demand.
