## Company Information (required)
* Taiwan Shengwei Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. was established in 2013 by two former Qualcomm and CSR communications engineers. It has been in development for 8 years. 
*  We have so far manufactured for D-link, NETGEAR, Jabra, Vodafone Australia and Softbank of Japan, dozens of WiFi routers and several Bluetooth headsets, including 802.11N, WiFi-MIMO, 5Gwi-fi, Wi-fi6 and other wireless routers and Bluetooth5.0 A2DP, Bluetooth5.0 BLE and other series of Bluetooth headsets. 
* We have accumulated and manufactured more than 400,000 OEM devices for customers.
* We went to China to participate in the exhibition, and a partner came over and asked if we could provide helium mining machines.

## Product Information (required)
*  Redsuns-HNT1
* This is full hotspot.
* It is for indoor.
* We use RaspBerry Pi4B as the calculation and control module of the mining machine. We use chipmatrix M302 (sx1302 inside) as lora's communication gateway.（CN470、EU868、US915） At present, we have successfully completed the steps of connecting the Raspberry Pi to the lora gateway, but I did not find the HNT code, nor can I upgrade the Raspberry Pi and Lora gateway modules to Helium Mining.  

## What is your approximate price point? (required)  

We recommend that the retail price be in the range of US$700

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.

According the setting of LPIOT-302(CN470) gateway, we could have the LoRa Gateway product.

## Startups welcome! 
* Have you shipped anything in the past? Yes or No

    Yes

* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 

  Yes

* Which countries do you plan to ship to? 

  North America, Japan, Australia and China

## Customer Support (required)
 Client will be able to reach us through telephone, online store chat, email, and discord. 

We plan to provide 1 year warranty to our product. We will stock products in US, Australia and Japan for replacement. Products will be repaired in Taiwan


## Hardware Security Element (required)
* We will encrypt firmware
*  we can add the ECC608 security module to the second generation of products.
* We will encrypt storage of miner swarm_key through disk encryption.
* we are willing to submit a prototype for audit and share results publicly.

## Hardware Information (required)
* Please let us know:
  1.Main control module, RaspBerry Pi4B
  2.Lora Gateway is SX1302

* Which security (swarm) element are you using? 

   Encrypt Firmware

* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 

  We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs. The Lora chipset of our device is Semtech SX1302

* Where are you sourcing your components from? 

  We can purchase equipment in Taipei and Chengdu

* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 

  We can buy 3000 sets

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? 

  Yes, we have manufactured and delivered WiFi routers and Bluetooth headsets

  Yes, we have established a WIFI gateway. And the two founders of our company are from Taiwan Qualcomm and CSR. We have rich manufacturing experience in WiFi and Bluetooth wireless communications.

* How many gateways did you make?

   We have made WiFi-AC, WiFi-AG, WIFI-5G, 3 gateway products.

* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

   We do not need third-party manufacturers. We have manufacturing capabilities and have our own manufacturing plants in Xizhi, Taipei and Dongguan, China. Therefore, we have no third-party R&D or foundry risks.

## Proof of Identity

Taiwan ShengWei Electronics Technology Company is100% owned by Yanming Kwok and xiaogang Xie Contact Info: +0086-0980678300 Email:Eroskwok@gmail.com Add:Block A, 9th Floor, No. 273, Section 4, Xingyi Road, Da'an District, Taipei City.

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 

  We estimate that the first batch of 2,100 units will be manufactured, of which 2,000 will be sold, 100 of which will be used as maintenance spare parts, and 10,000 units will be sold throughout the year in 2022.

* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to?  

  We have allocated US$50,000 for preliminary design and development, manufacturing testing of engineering samples, and related certifications. In the future, we will invest 400,000 U.S. dollars for the production and manufacturing of encrypted mining machines and market operations.

* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures - getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 

  We are a small R&D and manufacturing company specializing in the field of wireless communications, and have been serving several major OEM fixed partners for many years. So far, we have stable customers and healthy financial status. We will independently operate the HNT project. We use the initial capital of the project as the early angel investment of the project, and in the later stage, we can obtain financial support through VC or market fundraising. Of course, I also hope to get official funding and technical support from Helium.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
+ Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them. 

   We believe that excellent supply chain integration and excellent product experience are the core elements for products to be favored. We have many years of experience in manufacturing WiFi and Bluetooth wireless devices, which can help us better improve HNT devices, and we can get first-hand chips in Taiwan. So we are confident that we can run this project well.
