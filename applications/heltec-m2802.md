# Chengdu Heltec Automation Technology Co., Ltd.
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

Heltec Automation is a provider and manufacturer of all-in-one Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, with a focus on LoRa/LoRaWAN. We offer a comprehensive product line encompassing LoRa end nodes, LoRaWAN gateways, and LoRa cloud servers. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive solution to all users through the use of any of our products.

It would be extremely beneficial that the Heltec Hotspots were approved after September 2021. We've been honored to be a Helium certified third-party supplier since 2021, and our first generation helium hotspot, the Heltec Indoor Hotspot (HT-M2808), has been instrumental in our success in the IoT and blockchain space. We now intend to introduce a new generation of hotspots (model HT-M2802), with the goal of providing users with an improved product experience.

## Company Information

We began developing and selling LoRa/LoRaWAN products in Q3 2017, having been founded in 2014. With extensive experience developing LoRa devices and associated cloud computing, we migrated the Arduino and associated toolchain for the ASR650X series SiP in 2019. This is the first time that a PSoC series MCU has been demonstrated to be capable of running Arduino flawlessly (We call it CubeCell Series). Our products are used by partners worldwide, including in remote Antarctica (Scott Base).

We operate our own rework facility for SMT components. As a result, we conduct all R&D, manufacturing, and testing in-house, allowing us to maintain strict control over the manufacturing process and product quality.

The Helium blockchain, in our opinion, provides a decentralized public network that communicates with the blockchain. Everybody benefits from and contributes to this network. This will significantly aid in the large-scale deployment of LongFi/LoRaWAN networks, paving the way for the near future Internet of Everything. This is why we seek certification as a manufacturer of officially approved hotspots.

## Product Information

The following are our current LoRa related products:

- Helium LongFi Hotspot (HT-M2802): [Heltec Indoor Hotspot](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m2808/)
- Heltec LoRaWAN Gateway series: [Heltec Gateway Series](https://heltec.org/proudct_center/lora/lora-gateway/)
- Heltec LoRaWAN Node series: [Heltec LoRa End Node List](https://docs.heltec.cn/#/en/products/lora/lora_node/heltec_lora_node_list)

We have amassed a wealth of experience in product design, structural design, and manufacturing during the R&D and production of LoRa products. Our design philosophy prioritizes market-oriented products. The term "market-oriented" here does not simply refer to what users require; it refers to a variety of factors such as whether the upstream supply chain can meet production requirements or not, and whether the chips, components, and other components required by the product have a sufficient life cycle or can still be purchased on the open market.

### Heltec Indoor Hotspot (HT-M2802)

![](heltec/07.png)

&nbsp;

HT-M2802 is an upgraded version of HT-M2808. In the new generation of HT-M2802, the biggest change is to replace the SX1308 chipset with the SX1302/3 chipset with better performance and lower heat generation.

**Estimated price:** 439 USD

## Hardware Security

All the miner variants feature a secure element, powered by ATECC608 from Microchip. And the key data to be secured (`swarm keys`, `API tokens`, etc) are kept in a separate partition which is encrypted and secured by using the secure element.

Additionally, prior to performing the firmware upgrade, the hardware and copyright verification processes will be performed. We have a wealth of experience in this field. Beginning in 2020, each product we create will include a serial number that can be used to verify its authenticity, unlock software permissions, and obtain corresponding technical information and support.

## Manufacturing Information

Each year, we sell over 300,000 LoRa devices, which include LoRa gateways, LoRa end nodes, LoRa development boards, and LoRa modules. And this data continues to grow. All of our products are manufactured in-house at our SMT manufacturing facility. Daily assembly capacity is up to 600,000 components. As a result, we offer PCBA services to our customers in addition to manufacturing our own products. Throughout this process, we've developed a strong and stable working relationship with a variety of suppliers, ensuring a steady supply of a variety of devices.

If we are fortunate enough to be approved as a hotspot manufacturer, we will discontinue offering public PCBA services. Our factory will be responsible for fully manufacturing, testing, and assembling Heltec's hotspots and other products.

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted in private.

## Budget & Capital

We have enough funds available to produce large volumes. This money is independent of our daily working capital. 

## Risks & Challenges

From the perspective of Q3 2020, the shortage of chips globally become a barrier for most hardware manufacturers.

We identified the primary challenge as the worldwide shortage of chips and electronic components beginning in Q3 of 2020, as well as the inability to guarantee lead times. This, I believe, is also a roadblock for the majority of hardware manufacturers.

As a result of our accumulated experience in the field, we purposefully avoided highly visible devices when designing the products. And we keep a certain quantity of component in stock to cover initial production.
