## Company Information

TEKTELIC Communications Inc. is global End-to-End IoT technology solution provider. TEKTELIC helps its customers achieve the lowest Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by providing hardware and software solutions that are designed for Carrier Grade reliability, mass scalability and seamless deployment. TEKTELIC has been designing and manufacturing custom hardware products since 2009 for the world’s largest Tier 1 mobile operators and large enterprises. TEKTELIC products are currently deployed worldwide in various industries including wireless network infrastructure, national defense, municipal metering and property insurance.   
TEKTELIC Introduced it’s IoT Gateway product line to the market in 2015 and since that time has shipped over 100,000 units (20,000+ outdoor and 80,000+ Indoor).
As a leading manufacturer of LoRaWAN products and solutions, TEKTELIC is keeping tabs on the LoRaWAN ecosystem and is aware of the emerging demand and excitement for Helium Hotspots.

## Product Information

TEKTELIC is leveraging its expertise as the world’s premier manufacturer of LoRaWAN gateways to build a variant of it’s market leading KONA Micro & Enterprise Gateway integrated with the Helium Cloud Miner. 
The KONA Micro IoT Gateway is designed for enterprise and lightweight industrial applications that require “Always On” connectivity. This 8 channel LoRaWAN® gateway is configured with an internal 3G/4G modem and a built-in battery backup, the KONA Micro IoT gateway continues to operate and transmits sensor data to the network even when the main site has lost power. Simple to configure and cost effective, it is an ideal hub for deployment of enterprise-level applications in areas where public LoRaWAN® coverage is not yet readily available or for private networks where the operator requires unfettered access to the gateways regardless of their deployment location. Since its introduction to the market in 2017, TEKTELIC has shipped over 60,000 units of this gateway globally.
The KONA Enterprise LoRaWAN® Gateway is designed for small and mid-size enterprises, universities, agricultural, forestry and remote operations. In order to facilitate rapid deployment, one needs only to provide POE power. The Gateway is very compact and lightweight, comes with integrated Cat-6 3G/4G modem and Ethernet backhaul. The LoRaWAN, 3G/4G and GPS antennas are integrated within the enclosure. For remote applications and extra flexibility, it also supports optional external LoRaWAN and 3G/4G Antennas. The ESD and Lightning protection are integrated across all its interfaces. 
The KONA Enterprise LoRaWAN Gateway meets IP-67 environmental specifications for most demanding outdoor installations. With MTBF of 450,000 hours or 50 years, is it virtually “always on” and the operators lowest TCO.
TEKTELIC is designing our own commissioning tool to bring our gateways to the Helium network. We intend to use our KONA Element Server which is capable of remote updates.  We are targeting Q4 to have our first production build complete. Our sole reseller (at this time) Cal-Chip Connected Devices will be driving the volume based on their forecasts.  

## Previous shipments

TEKTELIC has FCC and CE certification on our LoRaWAN gateways.  We sell our products direct to our clients globally in additional to leveraging local resellers. 

## Customer Support

TEKTELIC is looking to leverage the 3rd party organization Emrit https://emrit.io/ to offer customer support for our gateways operating on the Helium network. They will provide Tier 1 and 2 support and TEKTELIC supporting level 3 to Emrit should such an issue arise.  In the event a gateway must be repaired within the 1 year standard warranty, Emrit would organize a RMA with TEKTELIC and we would replace with a new unit. TEKTELIC may also choose to support select clients directly.  

## Hardware Security

In order to satisfy the security requirement on the Light Hotspots, TEKTELIC will be adding the ECC608 chip to our board. TEKTELIC will also implement firmware package signing.

## Hardware Information

TEKTELIC hotspot hardware is based on our current Micro & Enteprise gateways which share the same hardware and software platform. The Micro is our indoor variant while the Enterprise is the IP67 rated outdoor.  This hardware platform includes a Semtech SX1308, a TI AM335x processor, ECC608 secure element, and the Enterprise gateway alone contains a GPS receiver. 
TEKTELIC has a number of CM's who purchase materials for our builds.  We also purchase direct should it be necessary. 
Supply chain and demand are the only limiting factors in regards to the volume of radios TEKTELIC can procure.  

## Manufacturing Information

Over the past five years TEKTELIC has shipped over 100K LoRaWAN Gateways to customers globally. TEKTELIC has partnered with two Contract Manufacturers, one based in in Europe and the other in North America to support the product builds and order fulfillments to global customers. TEKTELIC’s European Contract Manufacturing partner is the highest volume CM in the world outside of the China region. Having CM partners in both North America and Europe allows TEKTELIC to fulfill orders quickly and efficiently to any global location and partnering with these leading companies enhances TEKTELIC’s buying power for materials and components.

## Proof of Identity

TEKTELIC is wholly owned by the company co-founders Roman Nemish and David Tholl. TEKTELIC is cash positive and funds raised have been organic without engaging VC’s or any other channels.

## Budget & Capital

TEKTELIC has already completed the development of the hardware and software necessary to enable the Helium Cloud Miner.   This was done by leveraging already existing gateways (KONA Micro and KONA Enterprise).   These products are already widely sold globally, and will continue to be maintained and marketed as part of the Helium eco-system and broader global LoRa Alliance eco-system.   In addition to this, TEKETLIC has slated some of its additional gateways to receive the Helium required modifications.    Again, TEKELIC will invest in these changes as the market for these gateways and the Helium requirement matures.  

## Risks & Challenges

The global component shortage that is currently being faced by the market imposes some risk for TEKTELIC, however the strategic partnerships we have developed over the past 12 years in both the on the supply chain and manufacturing side helps to mitigate this risk as we have many sourcing options and leverage to expedite.  The impact of the component shortage for TEKTELIC has been minimal thus far.
