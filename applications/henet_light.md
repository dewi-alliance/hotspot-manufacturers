# HeNet B.V. / LongAP
### Application to become an approved third party light hotspot manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

HeNet B.V. previously sold the LongAP One hotspot. We are now introducing the **LongAP Pro** and **LongAP Light** hotspots. 

## Company Information

HeNet B.V. is a company from the Netherlands that specializes in security solutions with the main focus on cryptography. 
We previously sold the LongAP One Helium hotspot.

## Product Information

Our products are aimed at the professional market. We won't be selling to the consumer market. 

### LongAP Pro

**Expected release date**: Q4 2021 - Q2 2022 (depending on launch of light-hotspots on the Helium network)

LongAP Pro will be a light-hotspot in an outdoor IP65 housing.

**Specs**:
- 800 MHz Dual-Core MIPS processor
- 256 MB of RAM
- Gigabit ethernet with PoE
- LoRa concentrator based on SX1302 (EU868 initially)
- Fiberglass +3dBi LoRa Antenna with N-type connector
- Metal case (pole and wall mount supported)
- Powered over PoE
- Security chip that stores hotspot/swarm-key

Option LTE:
- 4G/LTE Cat 1 interface
- GPS
- Internal 4G/LTE+GPS antenna
- World-wide SIM with data installed that can be enabled in our dashboard

Option Solar:
- Kit to run LongAP Pro off-grid on solar and batteries. 

### LongAP Light

**Expected release date**: Q2 2022 (depending on launch of light-hotspots on the Helium network)

LongAP Light will be a light-hotspot for indoor usage.

**Specs**:
- 500 MHz MIPS processor
- 128 MB of RAM
- 100M ethernet with PoE
- 2.4 GHz 802.11b/g/n WiFi with internal antenna
- LoRa concentrator based on SX1302 (EU868 initially)
- RP-SMA external +3dBi LoRa Antenna
- Powered over PoE or using 12V DC-jack
- Security chip that stores hotspot/swarm-key

## Customer Support

Support will be provided over e-mail and our own Discord and general troubleshooting will be available on our website. 

## Hardware Security

Our devices contain a security-chip for key-storage and cryptographic operations. Keys are non-exportable ensuring a high level of security.

## Proof of Identity

Submitted and verified by DeWi during previous HIP19 application.

## Budget & Capital

We have enough funds available to produce in the required volumes. 

## Risks & Challenges

The semiconductor shortage is still ongoing resulting in very long lead-times for critical compoments. We already sourced a number of critical components (for example the security chips) and have them currently in stock, however new supply could have long lead times.
