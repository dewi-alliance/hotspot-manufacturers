<br>ResIOT also has an RMA procedure to handle hardware repair or replacement: https://login.resiot.io/rma.php

## Hardware Security Element
In order to meet the security requirements of the current Helium hardware guidelines, besides other industry-standard software-based measures, ResIOT hotspots use the <b>Microchip ECC608B</b> secure element, a component able to generate and store the swarm_key and to ensure the highest grade of security.
The ECC608B can store secrets and process security functions using private keys.
Additionally, when signatures and encryptions are performed, the key is never exposed to the OS or in the RAM.
ResIOT locks the key registers in a non-reversible way, which makes it impossible for anyone to overwrite or accidentally lose an existing private key. Even if the hardware is physically compromised, the key cannot be recovered or overwritten.

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? **Secure boot is enabled by default on all our gateways. Secure boot detects tampering with boot loaders, key operating system files and unauthorized flashing. Detections are blocked from running before they can attack or infect the system**
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No? **ResIOT X1 indoor miners are shipped with a built-in temperature, accelerometer and shock detection system. Thanks to the ResIOT IoT platform where the miners are registered by their users, it's possible to create and configure events based on the sensor readings**

## Hardware Information
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using?  **We rely on the Microchip ECC608B secure element to store private keys.** 
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? **SX1303 + 2xSX1250**
* What is the CPU? **Hexa-Core Cortex ARM, 2x A72 dual core 2Ghz + 4x A53 quad core 1.4Ghz**

## Manufacturing Information 
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? **Yes, we have extensive experience building and shipping LoRaWAN Gateways for both indoor and outdoor. We have shipped over 3.000 gateways.** 
* Have you built gateways before? **ResIOT started manufacturing and selling its own industrial gateways in 2016.**
* How many gateways did you make? **ResIOT has already sold and delivered over 3.000 gateways - X2, X4 and X7 models**
* Where are you sourcing your components from? **Global supply chain**
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? **As stated above, we have 3.000 pieces ready for shipment once certification from dewi is done**

## Proof of Identity
ResIOT is more than happy to provide proof of identity to DeWi and/or Helium

## Budget & Capital
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales? **Between 3.000 and 15.000**
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? **Orders to build the first 15.000 pieces have already been paid for. Depending on market conditions, ResIOT will be able to order components for additional 5/10k miners/month or more if demand increases!**
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? **As a company, we have an excellent relationship with our financial institutes that have been supporting us for the last 10 years. In addition, we also have sources of private financing so that we can maximize the availability of cash flow throughout the production and sales process.**

## Risks & Challenges
Chip shortage is an issue today, as well as the reliability of the shipping and distribution networks. LoRa modules need to be pre-ordered 10 months in advance, other components orders have to be placed months in advance and that requires some serious planning. We have a lot of experience with manufacturing our own hardware, so we don’t anticipate any other issue as we've been working with our manufacturer partners for years and we know they can deliver.

## ResIOT Helium Console
ResIOT offers the ability to register your hotspots over the dedicated [ResIOT Helium Console](https://helium.resiot.io).
<br>Miners registered over the ResIOT Helium Console have access to a range of features offered by the online platform:
* Hardware performance monitoring
* Geolocation monitor
* Helium Mining stats
* Customizable alerts whenever a gateway timeouts or is offline
* Read and handle the miner sensor readings: ResIOT X1 is shipped with built-in temperature, accelerometer and shock sensors. Smart triggers can then be configured based on user logic rules.
* Remotely update software on the hotspot on-demand or via scheduled tasks
* Remotely access your gateway on-demand (optional)
