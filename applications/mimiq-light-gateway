## Integrated Consumer Devices

Mimiq plans to provide enhanced integration for its devices - the Mimiq GO and upcoming Mimiq Track, including (optional) attractive bundle pricing for consumers. Regardless the gateway will be always available as a standalone device. 

## Customer Support

Mimiq has multiple years of experience in supporting thousands of end consumers customers in the US and elsewhere. We also run our own branded ecommerce store. In Q2 2022 we will be re-launching our Mimiq GO and rolling out Mimiq Track products into Amazon and later in Q2/Q3 into prestigious Tier 1 Retail brands. These processes are already well underway.

In order to scale for this kind of growth we have already onboarded team members with years of Amazon / FBA experience. We have also established a sophisticated hybrid 3PL network across the USA Including to support product returns. 

All products currently being sold in the US have included warranties with customer friendly return policies. We have also established processes for high speed replacements in the rare event of a product replacement.

We have rolled out into Canada, EU already and anticipate Lat Am by Q3, with planned 3PL and distribution partners for those areas as well. They also include warranties and easy to access support. 

We carry the necessary insurance, either directly or via relevant contracted partners (that ship, import, sell  products) and for end use of product. 


## Hardware Security

Mimiq, along with our partner Sagem has prioritized secure designs and secure manufacturing from the very beginning. The HUB gateway is no different. Our product has integrated ECC608 Crypto Authorization Cell to securely contain swarm-key. And is planned to be sealed with epoxy to make it harder to reach internal electronics.

Our partner Sagem Teknoloji has been a trusted subcontractor for primes supplying Western military and govt entities. They have years of experience in highly secure manufacturing, physical and in-process protection of keys and in fabrication of tamper-resistant hardware electronic products as well as working with partners who specialize in the end to end secure transport of components for the same.

## Manufacturing, Budget & Capital

Mimiq and Sagem Teknoloji have committed adequate capital to produce upwards of 10K units per month. Adequate budget for parts procurement, manufacturing and distribution have been set aside to meet this requirement keeping in mind the roles of each partner. 

We expect that within a maximum of 10 weeks of approval that we have commitments that will allow us to manufacture upwards of 10,000 units a month and are making this commitment after having received high confidence sourcing commitments.

## Risks & Challenges

Key risks and challenges contemplated at this time include the worldwide shortage of chips and select electronic components.
