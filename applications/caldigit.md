# CALDIGIT
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

CalDigit is the leader in Thunderbolt docking stations with a history of working with high-bandwidth demanding computer peripherals. We have plans to build a Light Hotspot and a regular Hotspot, and will harness our experience making 10Gb network adapters to build a powerful and robust solution. Additionally, we plan to use our knowledge of IP67 to enhance the outdoor use of the Light and Regular Hotspots.

## Company Information

CalDigit opened its doors in Placentia, CA in 2006 and began by making RAID storage for creative professionals such as NBC Studios, National Geographic, and the BBC. In 2011 we were brought onboard by Intel and Apple as a developer for Thunderbolt 1, and have maintained a close relationship with Intel and Apple ever since. 
CalDigit is best known for Thunderbolt docks that turn lightweight laptops into powerful desktop solutions. However, we also make portable SSD-based storage devices, desktop RAID storage, 10Gb network solutions and USB-C attachments. We have over 20 products in our catalog, and have teams in the United Kingdom, Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan looking to add more.

## Customer Support

CalDigit’s greatest strength is our customer support. We are one of the few companies that still has US-based phone support. We do not rely on automated messages and offer technical help over phone, email, and chat. 
CalDigit offers support in English, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, and Chinese. In addition to the aforementioned languages our website and product documentation is provided in German, French, Dutch, and Italian.
With five offices across the globe CalDigit technical support is available 24 hours a day.


## Hardware Security

We plan to adopt the ECC608 security element chip to increase the security of the swarm key. In the meantime, we are evaluating more options, such as other security element chips, to increase our hardware security.

## Manufacturing Information

CalDigit has factories in Taiwan and Vietnam in the heart of Asia’s computer manufacturing hub.  Our factory is ISO certified and is positioned to export to the U.S. without any restrictions, unlike Chinese made products. Existing products like 5G CPE, Wi-Fi mesh router, and smart IOT devices are produced by the Vietnam factory, with monthly output of close to 1 million units per month.

## Budget & Capital

CalDigit is prepared to invest over USD $5 million  to bring a Light and Regular hotspot to fruition. We have research and development teams in the US and Taiwan, and have a mechanical engineering department in China. Over the course of 15 years we have maintained strong relationships with many manufacturers across Asia and are confident in our process and supply chain.  
Besides budgeting for production we will dedicate additional resources to advocate the Helium network. We have plans to use our videography department to create clips on how to set-up the hotspot, trouble-shooting connectivity issues, and the overall benefits of using Helium.

## Risks & Challenges

Currently there are global shortages on IC and other electronic components. CalDigit works with a multi-billion dollar electronic manufacturer, who has world-class supply chain capability to overcome material supply shortages.
