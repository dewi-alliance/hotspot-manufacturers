## Hardware Security Element 

Milesight Light Hotspots have embedded the encrypt chip  [ECC608B](http://resource.milesight-iot.com/files/ATECC608B-CryptoAuthentication-Device-Summary-Data-Sheet-DS40002239A.pdf) 
 on the board to store and secure the swarm_key.

Milesight Light Hotspots have an embedded hardware security built in the CPU i.MX8 , which is NXP Cryptographic Acceleration and Assurance Module (CAAM, [i.MX8 guide](http://resource.milesight-iot.com/files/IMX8MMCEC.pdf)-Page8), CAAM is built-in hardware module that implements secure memory(32KB) and a dedicated AES cryptographic engine for encryption/decryption operations, A device specific random 256-bit OTPMK private key is fused in each SoC at manufacturing time, this key is unreadable and can only be used by the CAAM for AES encryption/decryption through the Secure Non-Volatile Storage (SNVS) companion block. 

Every time when the gateway is powered on, CAAM will verify whether the bootloader and the firmware's signature matches by the burned key inside the SoC before proceed or stop. When try to upgrade or downgrade the firmware, the CAAM will act the same behavior in SoC before load it or refuse it. The bootloader itself cannot be modified (locked and signed).

## Hardware Information  Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
UG65(Indoor version) and UG67(outdoor version) share the same hardware design.
- CPU: NXP i.MX 8M Mini
- Security Chip: ECC608B
- LoRa chipset: SX1302
- Software Setup info: Web GUI for full configuration details, and scan QR code for onboarding.


## Manufacturing Information 
Milesight IoT designs and produces all the products in our own production plant, since our supply chain is well managed, our business is still growing rapidly even COVID-19 is still impacting the supply chain worldwide.

## Proof of Identity:
Has submitted privately to DeWi during applying the full hotspot last year.

## Budget & Capital 
Milesight Group has been well reputed world widely since 2011, we are shipping thousands of devices worldwide and we have enough funds to purchase raw materials for really larger orders.

## Risks & Challenges: 
Our business is still growing rapidly and orders are rushing in every day, lead time for larger orders may be longer than usual because chipset supply now is a worldwide problem. 

Our sourcing team is watching the market and purchasing the materials as soon as we find available stock in the market.
