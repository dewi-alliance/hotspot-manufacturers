It runs on the arm hardware platform, the operating system is Linux.

* Plan for software setup and configuration for the devices.<br />
 
Software remote upgrade is realized through network ports, GPRS and other networks:<br/>

1.Regularly send a request to the server to report the current version and receive files<br/>
2.Request file download<br/>
3.If the network is interrupted, that is, the "update file table" exists, repeat the second step<br/>
4.If the file check code and the updated file provided on the server are deleted during the update process, repeat the first ste<br/>
