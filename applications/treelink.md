## Previous shipments (required)

## Startups welcome! 
* Have you shipped anything in the past? Yes or No
* Yes

* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 
* China, CNAS

* Which countries do you plan to ship to? 
* North America, Europe, Asia

## Customer Support (required)
* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products? 
* The client will be able to reach us through telephone, online chat, and email. 

* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 
* We plan to provide 1 year warranty to our product. We will stock products in US and Germany for replacement. Products will be repaired in Hangzhou China.

## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? 
* Yes

* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
* Yes

* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?
* No

* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
* Yes

## Hardware Information (required)
* Please let us know:

* Which security (swarm) element are you using? 
* ATECC608A/B

* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs 
* SX1302 and SX1250s 

* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
* Semtech China & Microchip China & Element14

* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 
* 250K

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
* Yes, We have been engaged in the design of wireless products. We have a professional RF design team, including antennas, PCBs, and schematics. And we also have factory to manufacture the gateway. We have a complete radio frequency test equipment.

* Have you built gateways before? 
* Yes, We have many IoT gateway products.

* How many gateways did you make? 
* 10K

* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
* We have a long history of business relationships with trusted manufacturing partners and have successfully delivered major projects over the years.


## Proof of Identity
* Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 
* We are willing to provide contact information and identification via email.

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
* We plan to make 60k in 2022 and 100K in 2023.

* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
* We reserved `US$3M` to support this project initially, more to invest according to the progress of project.

* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures - getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 
* Our business is profitable, the shareholders could invest `US$5M` fund to support this project. We have cooperative investors who can invest `US​$5M` after our shipments exceed 25K.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
* Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
* The main risk is the continuity of the materials used to manufacture the product and maintaining sufficient quantity in the warehouse to fill any shortage of shipments. In addition to marketing the product and opening new markets, we will keep advancing to market the product. The time we spent doing helium integration testing and the time we spent communicating with each other to solve the problems encountered in the process.
