## Summary

Helium is a pioneer in building a global IoT network, with huge potential and value. With our professional competence and production capacity, we aim to help expand the coverage range through building Helium gateways: connecting consumers, businesses, and developers. We will uphold the Helium values and strike to bring the best products and services to #ThePeople.

*We build both full and light gateways.

## Company Information (required)


Aitek Inc, founded in Dedham, Massachusetts, is a company with a compound business model, channeling solutions for modern demands of high technology. We have many resources, which can be used to design, optimize, and manufacture our products. Our founder who also founded Authright Inc, a company specialized in cyber security, is backing up our project by providing consulting and support. Well connected with our business partners/friends in the industry, we can provide and power up a complete supply chain. Not only with software security and application but also involved with chip design and optimization, which resulted in overall improvement of manufacturing and sales.

## Product Information (required)
* What is this product's model name or model number?  -  Aitek Miner Plus
* Is this is Light Hotspot or Full Hotspot? (please submit two separate applications for Full and Light hotspots)  -  Full Hotspot
* Is it for indoor or outdoor?  -  Indoor

For software applications, we have developed a customized Linux system for this project to ensure that the application can run stably, and as an added customized security strategy. The system integrates with a mature online upgrade program, which can ensure system upgrading while operating stably.

The approximate price point would be around 500USD(TBD).



## What is your expected production and delivery timeline? (required)

Upon approval, the first batch of delivery will arrive in 1-2 months.

## Previous shipments (required)
N/A
## Startups welcome! 
* Have you shipped anything in the past? - No
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products?  N/A

## Which countries do you plan to ship to and get regulatory certifications for? (required)
North America, Europe, AU Region, Southeast Asia, etc.

## Customer Support (required)


We will handle customer service requests via Email and Discord vendor channels, as well as the implementation of the Q&A section on our website. We will provide a one-year warranty on our device. To better serve the community, our team of customer service representatives with technical backgrounds is competent to answer questions and troubleshoot, before and after-sale. We also planned to implant real-time customer support right before our first big container arrived, to help break the stereotype of the lack of customer support in the Blockchain community. 


## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:  

  The swarm_key file stored into encrypted chip ECC608.

* Are you using an ECC608. - Yes 
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. - Yes
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. - Yes 
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. - Yes
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) - Yes 

We will protect the data by encrypt and store the swarm_key on ECC608 chips. 
Additionally, the gateway's OTA activity can only take place over secured SSL communication.

## Hardware Information (required)

* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using?  -  ECC608
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway?  -  SX1302
* What is the CPU?  -  Quad-core Cortex-A55 CPU

* Where are you sourcing your components from?  - Semtech for Lora Chips and other suppliers from China. We are well-connected with our friends across multiple fields for material sourcing.
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?  - We are expecting to procure at least 10k units per month. In the future if the capacity rises, we will procure and produce more.


* Other Hardware Specifications:

* RAM: 2G DDR4
* Security: ATECC608 swarm keys storage
* Flash: 64G eMMC
* Bluetooth: BT V4.2 EDR
* Ethernet: RJ45 Ethernet jack
* OS: Customization Linux System
* Wifi: IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Wireless LAN

## Manufacturing Information (required)

Our trusted manufacturing partners in China have a complete mass production supply chain of Helium miners. We are capable of producing around 10,000 units per month now and will continue to increase our capacity.
Upon approval, our team will be able to mobilize funds and start the mass production ASAP. The finished devices will be then transported to the US, waiting to be dispatched. Additional team members will be hired to support operation work. Our investors and technical expertise will assist us along the way, ensuring smooth production and transportation for the growing demand of Helium miners.



## Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital (required)

We intend to produce 10,000 units per month to meet the current demand and more after the first few batches. We have secured all the capital needed to bring the first batch to market.

## Risks & Challenges (required)

In order to continue our production with our robust supply chain for Helium miners, we aim to secure the stock of critical components beforehand. Despite the remaining impact of a global pandemic such as shortage of chips, transportation delay, etc, We will get through the disturbances and scale production to meet the growing demand.
