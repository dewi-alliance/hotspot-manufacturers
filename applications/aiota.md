# AIOTA Electronics Limited

### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

Helium has incredible potential to disrupt the industrial automation and IoT landscape and the community is growing rapidly day by day. That motivates and drives us to contribute to that disruption with as many resources as we can - not just by building hotspots, but with a full hardware and software ecosystem. We want to do this not because of pure financial motivation, but because we truly believe in open source and decentralization.We hope to better establish Lora's leading position in the communication field and witness the decentralized and open network communication scene described in helium's publicity.we will provide the cost-effective version of Helium miner to help the fast spread for Helium network.

In the near future, our aim is not just contributing the connective grid for the helium network, but also developing and providing the tools and sensors to the business parties.

AIOTA Electronics Limited is a product development company specialized in building world class decentralized networking equipment and microservice cloud native software.We plan to use our expertise in hardware and IoT to build an Indoor Light Gateway for the Helium Network. And actually we have already ported helium and make it running on our prototype hardware, but waiting for the Onboarding Maker Address to access to the blockchain. From techical point of view, there shall be no risk to build the helium product. We will overcome all the challenges and make it happen.

## Company Information
(Internet media，miner communities)

**AIOTA Electronics Limited**. was established in 2021. It is based in HongKong, a high-tech enterprise that specializes in the R&D, provide products and solutions in building world class decentralized networking equipment and IoT technologies. AKman Hotspot is AIOTA's competitive product in the domain of IoT in the future decade. The engineering team at AKman consists of seasoned industry veterans from tech, R&D, blockchain and manufacturing companies such as Bitmain and Huashuxin technology.Among our partners, two technology companies have participated in and built helium network to provide hotspot coverage.

## Previous shipments
* Have you shipped anything in the past? Yes.
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? FCC,CE,China, CNAS
* Which countries do you plan to ship to? US. China and Europe

## Customer Support ##

* Discord’s Vendor channel
* 7 * 24 hours customer enquiry
* FAQ section for customer to search the answers of their issues.
* The hardware maintenance service will be two year free for labor cost, provided hardware replacement if the breakdown of hardware comes from itself.
* The software issues could be solved by OTA upgrade.
* We do not rely on automated messages and offer technical help over phone, email, and chat.

We offer lifetime customer support to every product we sell. Even if you just buy a single product and call us 5 years later because you need some help, we will help you. Lifetime customer support will of course be included for all our Helium hotspots.

We promise to provide 18 months of free warranty. The company has its own independent warehouse. We will provide replacement service in the shortest time(in 1 week in china) due to the failure caused by the hardware of the equipment itself.

## Hardware Security Amendment ##

For each of our product, we take serious consideration and actions to safeguard costomer privacy and security.

* To prevent cloning, modification and corrupt software, we will use EMMC storage soldered on the board.
* We use the ECC608 chip as recommended by Helium to securely store the encrypted swarm keys.
* We will be more than happy to submit prototypes for audit. 

## Manufacturing Information ##
Huashuxin Technology Co., Ltd (referred to as Huashuxin) is an important partner of AIOTA, responsible for the mass production of AKman.
Huashuxin is an emerging computing equipment design, production and leasing service provider. It has deep experience in the design of a variety of encryption algorithm chips and computing chips. It is also a leading application provider of high-performance FPGA chips, and is committed to the research on the localization of FPGA chips. It is an international high-tech innovative enterprise with deployment of developers, computing equipment and IDC data centers in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Taizhou, Silicon Valley and Ottawa, Canada. Huashuxin has provided technical support for many well-known mining products, such as Avalon mining product.

We will be using a combination of two trusted manufacturing partners for production of the Light Gateway. Both manufacturing partners specialize in making commercial and industrial network equipment. Over the course of working with these partners for 1 years, we have built a good relationship and are confident that, together, we can delivery a high quality final product.

The product design and all technical parts of the project are nearly done. We will place the first production order immediately when we get manufacturer approval.

## Budget & Capital
Based on the current estimate and market insight, We intend to proceed with a first batch of 5000 to 10000 devices but we can scale this up should the pre-order demand require it and we have enough production capacity for this. we have strong investment partner that could provide enough support, but not normally needed.
We have secured materials for 6K gateways and reserved 2 millions USD cash to launch the product and run the business. And we are confident to obtain positive cash flow in half a year.

## Risks & Challenges

* Key risks and challenges contemplated at this time include the worldwide shortage of chips and select electronic components, In order to prevent the current supply shortage, we have purchased the chips needed for production in advance to meet the supply of subsequent customers. We will plan accordingly and will never promise to deliver if we can’t.
* Another thing to concern is the scale of our customer service with the growth of the network. More resource will be deployed.
* We are faced with more effective cost reduction so that miners can buy our products at a lower price. We're not worried about it
