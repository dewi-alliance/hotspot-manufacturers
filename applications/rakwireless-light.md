### HIP19 Amendment for light hotspot

## Summary

At [RAKwireless](https://www.rakwireless.com/), our mission is to enable entrepreneurs and enthusiasts to develop innovative products by creating and supplying breakthrough Internet of Things (IoT) technology and services to the market. We offer complete IoT solutions, including end-node sensors, gateways, and cloud computing. We work together with major ecosystems and produce a rapidly expanding pipeline of products at scale.

In 2021, RAKwireless launched [MNTD.](https://www.getmntd.com/), a consumer-friendly brand focused on making crypto-hardware accessible to everyday people. RAKwireless is the same company that built the original Helium hotspot and remains one of the most trusted manufacturers in the ecosystem with over 300k RAK and MNTD. hotspots shipped across Northern America and Europe.

As the Helium Network moves forward in 2022, Light Hotspots are introduced to address the issue brought my the massive scale-up of the network, removing the need for hotspot to sync and store the blockchain data on the device. With this improvement, Hotspots on the Network will run more smoothly and efficiently. 

As one of the mature suppliers of Helium Full Hotspot, MNTD. fully understands the requirements of Helium's Light Hotspot.

In this HIP19 Amendments we update RAK light hotspot information for audit.

## Company Information

**Shenzhen RAKwireless Technology Co., Ltd.** was established in June 2014. It is based in Shenzhen, China with an office in Beijing. Our collaborators span the planet from Asia (India, Philippines, Taiwan), Europe (Bulgaria, Portugal and UK) and the Americas (U.S.A., Colombia and Brazil)

We are an industry-leading full stack infrastructure and solution provider for wireless networks spanning across hardware and software from the edge to the core. Under our motto “**IoT Made Easy**” we offer the building blocks that allow our customers to deliver world class products and services.

## Product Information 

- What is this product's model name? (Hotspot models with different hardware will need a separate HIP19 application.)

  RAKwireless provide end-to-end solution and IoT product for low power, wide area IoT network. Our main product inclouding IoT modules, LoRa gateways and end devices. We have over 50 products currently in active production. Please consult [RAKwireless products](https://www.rakwireless.com/en-us/products) for the full list. To centralize the management of IoT gateway, RAKwireless developed WisDM which is a cloud management system deployed on AWS. 

  RAKwireless has manufactured and shipped over one million devices including over 300k LoRa gateways. Amongst those are the original Helium Hotspot as well as our own current RAK Hotspot Miner.

  We have collaborated with Helium from very early stage. Please see : [Why we believe helium was right from the very beginning](https://news.rakwireless.com/why-we-believe-helium-was-right-from-the-very-beginning/) .

  Our current Helium product is the **RAK Hotspot Miner**, now counting over 300k units active on the network. Our consumer brand [MNTD.](https://www.getmntd.com/) handles the retail distribution and support of the hotspots. 

  For this new product RAK leverages its experience in producing commercial gateways to design both indoor and outdoor Light Hotspots. 

  Indoor Light Hotspot: RAK7268V2H,RAK7268CV2H.

  Outdoor Light Hotspot: RAK7289V2H,RAK7289CV2H.

- Is this is a Light Hotspot or a 5G Hotspot? (New applications should be for Light Hotspots or 5G Hotspots)

  Light Hotspot.

- Is this model for indoor, outdoor, or both? (If there are two different models for indoor and outdoor, list them separately.)

  The Light Hotspot can be installed both indoor and outdoor. 

  Indoor Light Hotspot: RAK7268V2H,RAK7268CV2H.

  Outdoor Light Hotspot: RAK7289V2H,RAK7289CV2H.

- Provide a brief description of the product:

  All our Light Hotspot models incorporate 128MiB RAM, 32MB internal Flash and a SD Card (user accesible, for extra storage).

- What is your approximate price point?

  The Light Hotspot price will arrive at lower price point than the current Full Hotspot due to lower processing (CPU) and storage requirements.

  We expect the Indoor Light Hotspot will retail for US$199 and the Outdoor Light Hotspot will retail about US$599.

- What is your expected production and delivery timeline?

  Both indoor and outdoor version of the Light Hotspot are ready for mass production and shipment (pending availability of the final gateway-rs software stack from Nova Labs)

## Hardware Security Element 

- Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No?

  Yes

- Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or No?

  Firmware is locked down with no SSH access and it runs from the internal NOR flash. Firmware updates will require a valid signature. 

- Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?

  Yes, key is stored on the ECC608 secure element

- Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No? (Please note, the final design will be audited against this statement. Do not answer 'yes' unless the design will have these features and a description of where they are implemented can be provided.)

  No, the only anti-tampering measure related to the secure element is that it’s soldered on the main circuit board


- Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?

  Yes

## Hardware Information

- What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices? This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.

  For setup we will use our new MNTD. app. System updates will be offered over the air. 

- Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using?

  ECC608

- Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs.)

  We manufacture using our own assembly lines

- Where are you sourcing your components from?

  We purchase the LoRa parts from Semtech directly.

  100,000

- How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to?

  We estimated we need around 2 million USD up-front. We have enough capital in hand.

- What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.)

  We are backed by a leading venture company: Shunwei Capital and Cero Capital. We also are the leading IoT tech company in China and we have a strong finance system to manage the cash flow and supply chain.
