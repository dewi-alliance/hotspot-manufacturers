## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email Dewi (christina@dewi.org).

Yes
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?  Yes

## Hardware Information (required). Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.

* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) Not required for initial design.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.  

The biggest challenge facing the delivery schedule is supply-chain constraints. We have designed the product that can accommodate alternate hardware and have designed the product after validating the availability of critical components. Production will be carried out by our manufacturing partner Avalon (India)
