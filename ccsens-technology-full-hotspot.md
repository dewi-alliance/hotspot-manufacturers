## Hardware Security Element (required)

- The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan   for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19   will require additional review, please email Dewi ([christina@dewi.org](mailto:christina@dewi.org)).

- Are you using an ECC608. Yes or no?
  YES
- Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no?
  YES
- Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
  YES
- Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?
  YES
- Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
  YES

## Hardware Information (required). Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.

Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.

- What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?
  This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.
  Based on Qt development framework, develop and realize the compatible software(Android and IOS), complete the control and update of the equipment including wired and remote wireless communication, and synchronously build up supporting functions according to the hardware equipment requirements.

Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.

## Budget & Capital (required)

- How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales?
  We plan to produce and sell about 1000 vehicles.

- How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to?
  The capital required in the early stage is 10W USD. At present, the company's capital reserve is more than 100W USD, the floating capital is 30W USD.

- What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.)
  Not yet.

## Risks & Challenges (required)

Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
As to the current microelectronics market, there exists a shortage of various types of chips. We plan to complete the mature solution for the shortage of chips within 1 ~ 2 months, advance early warning at the first time, complete the reserve of key components in advance; At the same time, expand the supply chain, actively increase supply channels,  ensure the supply of key components.
