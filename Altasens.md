
Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19. 


Summary


Our mission is to grow the IoT network in South America and eventually expand our operations worldwide, to provide Helium Hotspots to crypto hobbyists and entrepreneurs. This will increase the Helium validators currently on the network and proof of coverage in South America which is one of Helium’s less covered areas worldwide. We take this as a win-win opportunity.




Company Information


Ongoing Partnership between Alta Intelligence & Southsens. Both companies are in the process of creating a joint company having both Alta Intelligence and Southsens as the parent companies in the United States of America (Altasens). Alta Intelligence has been in business for 2 years and is based in New York City, NY and SouthSens has been in Business for 3 years and is based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We have partnered with SouthSens to work with their engineering team to develop and manufacture Helium Hotspot Miners. We currently manufacture waste management and agricultural sensors that come with 2G, 3G and NBIoT / Cat-M1 capabilities. The sensors are installed inside the containers that collect data on filling height and temperature in real time. Each sensor is capable of measuring the fill level of the container, its internal temperature or detecting any sudden movement. Each device is remotely configurable through the web-enabled client. 


How many have you sold? 15,620 in the last two years. We believe there is great potential in South America to grow the Helium network as it has not yet grown to the scale as seen in Europe, North America and Asia. There is potential for the IoT industry to grow in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, whose crypto and mining markets have grown exponentially. Our goal is to satisfy the demand for Regular and Light Helium Hotspots in the South American continent and grow the Helium Network.

* For how long? 


1 year.


* How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 


We have a dedicated facility for any AltaSens X Hotspot Miners located in both Argentina and The United States that will handle all repairs and inspections of the Miners.


Hardware Security Element (required)


* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email Dewi (christina@dewi.org).


* Are you using an ECC608? Yes 


* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes


* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes


* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. 


Not as of yet


* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) 
Hardware Information (required). Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.


Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?


This would include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 


* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? 


We use an ECC608 encryption module.


* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (i.e. SX1302, SX1303, etc, only list one) We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs. 


SX1301 (For the preliminary design we chose to use this model, but in the future we plan to use the SX1302-1303)

Manufacturing Information (required)


* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?


As we mentioned before, we are dedicated to the manufacture of IoT products with cellular communication.


* Have you built gateways before? No


* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.


We have the support of the company HK HongKai Industrial Co., Ltd located in Lianjian Industrial Park Dalang LongHua District Shenzhen. In whom we trust several of our productions and we have direct contact with the CEO. Both the purchasing of components and the manufacturing are done on site.


* Where are you sourcing your components from? 


We have our local supplier in China, but we use the method of pre-ordering components from manufacturers directly through our supplier to avoid overpricing.


* How many radio modules / concentrators can you procure? 


At least 2500 in 6 / 8 months
























## Proof of Identity


To be separately submitted to DeWi.


## Budget & Capital (required)


We aim to produce 2,000 units in August 2022. Once we go into full production we will increase the amount based on the current demand. We have already spent $1.7 million on product development, material preparation, prototyping and labor. Project costs will continue to vary based on future development and geolocalized and geopolitical conditions. 










































Risks & Challenges


One of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality are the slow production and the crisis that china is having with it.


China's economy continued to slow at the start of the year, with manufacturing output slipping and Covid-19 outbreaks curbing consumer spending. The official purchasing managers' surveys released on Sunday showed a moderation in factory production and services in January:


  



If the crisis continues to be an issue with our production we will address the problem by manufacturing the product in argentina, a bit more expensive than what it costs producing it in china, but it is a way of still delivering our products.
