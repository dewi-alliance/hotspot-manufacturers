## <a name="summary" id="summary">Summary</a>

Novel, but heavier than helium gas, radon project falls on the ground and hits the network with vertical solutions adding value to the ecosystem.     

Radon Tech LLC https://radon.tech is an IoT company with scope in LATAM that was born from a network of experienced Argentine professionals led by Jose Vigil and encouraged by the novel cryptocurrency proposition applied to wireless. 

Composed of businessmen, entrepreneurs, software developers, hardware developers in the satellite industry and industrial designers all of us with a deep creative vocation, we decided to jump into the crypto world. This time, we all understood that unlike other cryptocurrencies Helium was not just a mining bet but a real utility within the scope of something we all work and love doing, playing with hardware and networks. 

Radon Tech LLC proposes breaking the mold with an out-of-the-box hotspot (aka HS) through design, modularity, custom hardware and a multi interfacing system for improving the user experience. 

#### <a name="brief-history" id="brief-history">Brief history</a> 

Things started back in May 2021 when we created the first witness in Buenos Aires that led us to continue improving, creating a mining company. Radon Network https://radon.network was foundational and allowed us to understand the problems faced by a user and the constant changes in the ecosystem and its rate. We got to know the community and its leaders, we understood the philosophy of the network but above all the vocation to do and share at a rapid phase. All this push and momentum naturally led us to create our own hotspot.

We set to work on a HS. Challenged to overcome a phenomenal rate of expansion of the ecosystem, we had to recalibrate the strategy several times with a series of solutions before moving ahead. Among them we had to come up with new ideas in the hardware supply, installation, user experience and expansion. 

#### <a name="product-context-analysis" id="product-context-analysis">Product context analysis</a>

From a product standpoint, we identify various kinds of problems likely to be solved with design strategies. These problems can be framed between the following subjects: _Supplies_, until now the most recurrent problem among manufacturing, _expansion_ to be recently considered as non-trivial, _installation_ and _user experience_ considering the user hereafter and _lower demand_. 

**Supplies**: The pandemic and war in Ukraine. We mitigated the hardware supply shortage with a custom -state of the art- design strategy avoiding ordering from a few suppliers and trying to manufacture as many components as possible. 

**Expansion**: Recently the need to expand to new tokens (HIP51) promotes and generates new coverage areas with different networks that are projected as hardware expansion. We believe that the HSs of the future will be able to be expanded with motherboards just like a compatible PC was expanded. We aspire to achieve that flexibility of expansion. We aim to allow users to keep up to date with the same hardware as much as possible over time.

**Installation**: The environmental changes for outdoor installation at height became mandatory and were solved with a modular casing and base applicable to all configurations. The quantity and variety of elements necessary for an installation were resolved with an out-of-the-box design that contemplates the basics for its operation. Including POE connector. 

**User experience**: Poor user experience, during the setup where there is no control or monitoring of HSs, during usage there is no immediate return of the status. In order to to improve the user experience a lightning system and protocol is proposed to indicate full status.

**Lower demand**: The sale of HSs is going through a drop in demand in the purchase of new devices. The clearest evidence is that you can get second-hand hotspots starting at $200. This is due to multiple factors, the most important being the drop in the value of the HNT below $10. 

#### <a name="status-and-proposal" id="status-and-proposal">Status and proposal</a>

We understand and are aware that we are a little bit late to the party of IoT mining and we are certain that it is not the best moment to apply to the HIP19 due to the HNT price and the drop in demand for HSs. However, this is the time to build and turn the page towards HIP51 adding value on management and infrastructure. 

We firmly believe that those current and new manufacturers that have aspirations to compete must be able to quickly adapt to these changes. Besides, 5G and the mobile token are opening a light on the way and a new horizon of growth added that the real IoT business is just beginning, makes us think that we are taking the right step. 

Therefore we built our HS with special features making it capable of surviving changes that ultimately can survive the POC. For all this and without further ado we introduce our good looking, modular multi interfacing and user friendly HEPOX Hotspot.

#### <a name="how-we-got-into-helium" id="how-we-got-into-helium">How we got into Helium</a>

An ATM network in the US from the financial sector brought us to Helium. The intent of mining inside ATM's (not so viable due to the closeness of the ATMs) led us to gain experience and learn from the technology. We started installing HSs in the outdoor at US locations and then in Argentina conforming to a mining unit towards the creation of the Radon Network project https://radon.network, our initial venture with mining. 

[![RadonLogoCurvas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/172821412-4dc7dcf6-e9db-4cb4-96c4-cf6c2209fd5c.png)](https://radon.network)

Oriented to B2B (entrepeneurs and small businesses), serves as a massive laboratory for learning Helium goods and bads. Coming from there, this is the main reason why Radon Tech strategy is and will always be user based. The mining project's spearhead is a software program that we call "Connect" that handles rewards for associates, partners and users, allowing a true business environment. A truly complementary and laboratory project for our manufacturing purpose while we adjust to the HNT changing economy.

</a>


### Introducing our good looking **Hepox** hotspot (helium-proof-of-coverage-survivor)

For interiors and exteriors it offers facilities for an out-of-the-box installation applicable to all kinds of conditions. Exhibiting a futuristic and high design value in casing applicable for all types of installations due to its modular base. A connector panel is located in the back, sheltered from the elements and protected from external factors. The base, where the HS can be fastened, is utilized in outdoors conditions and can be attached to flat, resistant surfaces, walls and pipes.

 <br>

|![books](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/177501331-7236add1-09b0-406f-83bc-f43496d4eeb3.png) | ![roof](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/183029518-b59af855-6de8-4fa9-aeaa-ab7c84092a6c.png)|
  
<br>

Being transparent to the user who can check the exact status of the HS through an innovative lighting system. The lightning system, including a proprietary protocol, the Radon activity interface system Protocol (RAIS) aims to indicate activity and status of the HS at a glance from everywhere (even from web, desktop and mobile apps), allowing a friendly and practical monitoring of one or more HSs. Leading to a manageable fleet of HSs and nodes that can also be applicable to 5G networks and installation management, a field of application with a lot of potential for the system.

## <a name="product-information" id="product-information">Product Information</a>

Model: **HEPOX** (helium-proof-of-coverage-survivor), is an indoor/outdoor light hotspot designed to last. 

Long-life, robust HS aimed for the community and professional sector and set it apart from other products for making life easier for those who work in the iOT industry and need to keep their services active and running 360 days a year. An outside of the box HS that can cope with all scenarios. From setup, control to management our roadmap is focused on providing them infrastructure and services so that they can improve the quality of the service.

Our Hepox HS has been created with special features. It was thought as a _modular design_ whose strategy applies to all its parts wherever you look at it covering all aspects of the product requirement. From the setup and installation standpoint, a versatile _base_ that suits all types on environments. From the expansion and upgrade standpoint, multiple antennas, an expandable motherboard, and an interchangeable _patch panels_, our HS aims to be a technological work of art. Like expansion cards used in old PCs, once sold, the user will be able to upgrade both hardware and firmware. Besides, a _lighting system_ is capable of reporting the status of the HS to the user in one shot (RAIS Protocol) without much effort. 

<br>

![hepox_sequence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/183027672-80f72ecb-67e0-4803-a56c-4f00956ad69c.png)

<br>

All the aesthetics and beauty of the HS is designed to be desirable, attractive and to transmit values to robustness, confidence and power. Aimed at a user who consumes state of the art products and who is in love with their devices.

**Price and Delivery**
Approximate price point: **$400**  
Expected production and delivery timeline: 10K in 1 year.

### <a name="aesthetic-design" id="aesthetic-design">Aesthetic Design</a>

We took into account that our Hepox  HP should be futuristic and that is reflected in its design mostly utilizing faceted lines present in the aerospace/satellite industry without neglecting that it should also reflect the culture of our customer. Enthusiast of crypto, possibly a gamer, communicative and attracted to the use of lightning that resembles kryptonite. We believe that Hepox meets our aesthetic requirements and modular design goals at the same time.

### <a name="modular-design" id="modular-design">Modular Design</a>

Hepox was designed to be modular in many ways. Within the framework of the speed of changes that sustain the Helium ecosystem, it was very necessary to create a HS that can be upgraded (hardware and software) in multiple ways, once shipped and installed. This fact would allow the HS to survive for a longer time. In fact, the name Hepox of the model emphasizes this statement.

With a modular strategy, we can guarantee that the same HS can incorporate new technologies without having to buy a new one. Giving our users the necessary accessories and support to update it by shipping the hardware component or updating the firmware software through the Internet. For this reason the installation or setup must persist and must be robust. Hepox can be placed in various contexts and scenarios due to its modular base for a good installation. 

Its modularity is applied and manifested in three important parts of the HS that are distinguished. 

**1. Antennas**   
Supports all types of N antennas. 
 
**2. Modules**    
Our custom board, featured with a carrier board and a PCI express connector for expansions.   


**3. Patch Panel**  
Supports basic and extended layouting configurations.   

<br>

![hepox_modular_system](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/181800859-e35d4fdd-030a-4828-8218-490ff003e718.png)

<br>

Hepox is deliberately robust in the installation and setup. We have focused on trying to guarantee a good experience and persistence over time in its environment. This strategy seeks permanence in the field and allows its expansion after having efficiently completed the installation.   

The base makes it versatile, it can be applied to a square or round spout, by or on a wall and with the absence of the base for an indoor state. The base is an accessory used outdoors where the HS fits perfectly and can be fastened to any surface. Can be attached to flat, resistant surfaces, walls and pipes.

<br>

![base](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/183027533-243b49ff-ee2e-477c-8403-c845178fbc7e.png)

<br>

The patch panel is a module that can be removed and exchanged for another one with a different configuration layout of connectors. The patch panel is enclosed into the cases in such a way that when it is opened it can be easily removed or replaced. A creative board to play with once a new technology is integrated having the possibility of modifying the number of connectors by only replacing it while keeping the core casing HS opening endless possibilities for versioning different HS with different technologies.

In this way, different configurations can be physically replaced in the panel, allowing different configurations that can go from a basic Lora layout with a button and a POE ethernet connector to an extended layout for 5G with USB, SMA connectors, multiple ethernet connectors and removable sim card if required. 

![panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/182044603-f14ca87a-e5f9-498b-9742-6cc9ae9355ff.png)

### <a name="lightning-system" id="lightning-system">Lightning System</a>

Until now all HS manufacturers have had to accomplish huge technical requirements in order to meet the demand of the community and expanding mining market. Pairing, onboarding, networking, coverage and so on and so forth to have all the necessary components for reasonable operation. Maybe the speed of expansion and high demand may not have allowed us all together to think differently. The time has come to start thinking about improving the user experience, to build better HSs from the user perspective.  

During Radon Network installation rollout, we evidenced many limitations in usability. Almost all manufacturers have naturally built "black boxes" from the UX point of view. Black because of the lack of feedback, the need to mount indoors into outdoors cases, due to of the distances from the floor to the ceilings, to the heights and to the limits of the coverage area. 

Ultimately, the climbs and downs -during and after installation- not knowing much about what's going on can end in more troubleshooting that at the end of the day make a deficient experience to the user. A user who already puts time and effort into achieving the most optimal installation possible, thus remaining competitive, deserves better interfaces and more qualified information during and after the process, management and support.

In this sense, we think there is plenty of space for improvement and it is our idea to be able to develop it together with the community. In addition, the special bond established between users with their HSs has proven to be even emotional and such connection requires a more permanent link, requires a more robust connection with the user, constantly and permanently.  

As a consequence, we are encouraged to think differently. We believe that by proposing a universal interface that starts with a lightning system compound of two lights, one bigger and below for the status and the other smaller and above for the activity, we can provide the users with a very good user experience. Agnostic, can be physical at the HS and visual via applications from where is customized. Through the use of colors, the possibility of showing states and activities in a single stroke of the eye view are endless in the different verticals for which it can be applied. We call this enhancement the RAIS Protocol, the Radon activity interface system.

### <a name="RAIS-protocol" id="RAIS-protocol">RAIS Protocol</a>

The RAIS (Radon Activity Interface System) protocol, currently under development, aims to help our user to fast diagnose and visualize glance the status and the activity of what is happening to the hotspot at that specific moment. Utilizing two colors (maybe more) for showing a simple interface that can be easily understood from far or near. In an initial version the protocol would cover local conditions of the HS during the setup and installation process. For example if it is pairing, connected, mining, transferring or upgrading and so on. However future versions should also include **node** interaction such us downlink and signal strength among other things. Following the same procedures, it is expected that the protocol also apply to 5G and Wifi.  

![RAIS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/180956478-a2135942-9d75-466b-8013-85b178cee58b.png)

Our goal is to be able to find cases that go beyond setup and node interaction. Our preliminary tests have shown us that we can find value for different cases that can apply to different verticals and we hope to open the protocol and share it with projects and companies to reach value. For this purpose we find an optimal path for developing by applying to the grant program.

### <a name="custom-board" id="custom-board">Custom Board</a>

The best products evolve over generations, with further customizing, and adding features on each revision. We aim to develop a height quality and long-term HS and we choose custom design. Reason why we choose a custom hardware design rather than a reference design. Make vs. buy is for us the best choice considering the type of product and wireless technologies to handle. Not unifying suppliers and components. Custom made by different suppliers or manufactured by our strategic partners.

Having control of the hardware and firmware in our opinion is fundamental for a more controlled development over software and hardware. Innovation demands customization and good hardware design isn’t about to become a commodity anytime soon.

Our partner manufacturer company Emwicon https://www.emwicon.com/ in Taiwan built and delivered radio hardware products as well as gateways, over 10 models.

| Gateways |
| :-- | 
| WiFi Gateway |
| BT Gateway |
| LTE Gateway |
| WiSUN Gateway |
| RF(433) Gateway |

Besides, also built IoT and communication devices like wifi, sensors for Industrial and commercial applications.
Emwicon is located in Taiwan that has become a strategic place for manufacturing due to the situation that the post-pandemic world is going through and the Ukraine-Russia war, the importance of alignment with a supply chain that is associated with the interests of the US and its allies, Taiwan plays an important role in the technological part, that is why the decision to manufacture it in Taiwan or Southeast Asia tomorrow. Therefore, the company is sourcing components from Taiwan and American accounts for 80%.

Emwicon has self-development capabilities of radio module, cooperative chip manufacturers: Realtek , Atheros , Qualcomm , WiSun , NXP, etc. Customer requests like Raspberry Pi, ESP, etc.

In addition, Google, Apple and other major American and European brands that manufacture or have manufactured their products in China are already withdrawing from China to produce in Taiwan and Southeast Asia such as Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Malaysia.

We have a 300k budget, 100k in-hand for the first prototype production. While HNT returns to a reasonable price and we <a href="#ride-out-the-storm">Ride Out The Storm</a> we manufacture a limited edition of 5k aiming to our close community and IoT partnerships with verticals. Once then, manufacture 5k during the next six months to complete a year of community iteration, alliances, upgrades and market presence.

## <a name="risks-&-challenges" id="risks-&-challenges">Risks & Challenges</a>


Back in the old days of HIP-19 and early 2021, when there was a huge demand from the community for buying new HSs, the main challenge for manufacturers has clearly been the supply of components. Furthermore, COVID-19 has severely disrupted supply chains globally and we continue to pay the costs of the pandemic. For manufacturers purchasing critical components on time and in the right way and at the right price has been, until now, by far the biggest challenge until to date. Furthermore microprocessor shortages are likely to run into 2024 due to Ukraine invasion and China lockdowns. But it is not just that.    
During the last six months, specifically since November 15 2021 when the price of HNT (that was $52.5 approximately) began to decline (like all cryptos) a **new challenge** for manufacturing suddenly emerged. The drop in demand for brand new Lora HSs.   

#### <a name="lower-demand-challenge">Lower Demand Challenge</a> 

By the end of 2021, the price of HNT started going down, reaching $6.5 approximately on May 20th. The lowest fall since genesis. Around April 2022, when the update to _light hotspots_ was applied and live. Due to the nature of the update changes, the network presented incidents that lasted several weeks and naturally remained causing mining issues. Besides, the overwhelming announcement of the HIP51 May 27th (A Network of Networks), opened an intriguing question about the future. The HIP51 turn of page is an outstanding move towards the expansion of the conglomerate of networks however this could generate a side effect in the community expecting the next thing, 5G HSs rather than Lora HSs. Meanwhile, the MCC's measures against gaming doesn't help an accumulated and potential distrust for the purchase of brand new Lora HSs. 

Furthermore also affecting the second-hand market price per unit falling below what we estimated as the approximate price point within this document. These sequence of events simultaneously made up for what we understand as the **perfect storm** for manufacturing Lora HS, at the time of this submission.

#### <a name="ride-out-the-storm" id="ride-out-the-storm">Ride Out The Storm</a>

If we are capable of understanding the storm, then we should be able to ride it out and provide value-added to the ecosystem without losing focus and without getting out of the manufacturing race. 

Our intention is to successfully submit, KYC, audit and while demand recovers improve product and value added. Switching into 5G seems to be a good path considering the size of the market and opportunity but it's too big a jump. In fact our modular approach for expansion contemplates new tokens and upgrades. However we must focus on our first stage, IoT, and ensure that the innovation we are putting together makes sense to the community and market. Once then yes, apply the experience to novel cases such as 5G setup with no spectrum definition in LATAM yet. A reasonable roadmap for a competitive HS will include new technologies such as 5G, WiFi 6E and coming DAOs when the time comes. 

Besides, with Arsultra know-how and partnership we envision to include a satellite connection that should provide coverage to our HSs in rural areas.   

With a limited edition of 5k, check <a href="#budget-&-capital">Budget & Capital</a>, we can iterate with the community enhancing the user experience improving the RAIS Protocol, setup and management. In this aspect, and mentioned in the RAIS Protocol explanation, we are looking forward to apply to the different tools offered by the alliance such as the **grant program**. This set of tools will help us to enhance and validate our execution plan.  

We hope our good looking, multi interfacing, modular, custom board and user friendly HEPOX hotspot would be welcome for the Helium community, geeks, nerds, technology enthusiastic and IoT professionals.
