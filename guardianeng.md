<img src = "https://github.com/setalab/hotspot-manufacturers/blob/main/gaudian_img/gaudian_logo.jpg">

Guardian E&G Co., Ltd. is a specialized IT convergence company combining electric / electronic and wireless communication technologies.

We have applied loT technology to existing road lighting (streetlight / security, etc.) and applied it to the smart grid (wireless remote lighting and energy control system), water grid (unmanned water meter reading system) , Disabled people, poor people, etc.) into one system, we are taking a step forward in enhancing the lives of the people through the "ONE-STOP Happy Safety System" Hanaro.

The Guardian wireless networking network, which was created by the Unimo and International Electronics technicians who produced the police station radio and VHF unidirectional wireless communication, is a powerful wireless communication network based on wide-area multi-party communication. It is able to transmit reliable information securely It is also possible to implement various additional services by building an "open" wireless network that can be used by third parties.

We will make every effort to provide more convenient services.

Thank you.

* What brought you to the Helium Network? 
  
From 2017, we Started the LoRa gateway construction project.
Received technology transfer from LoRa gateway developer called SETALAB.

Currently, LoRa gateways are being built throughout the local government of Daegu Metropolitan City in Korea.

The reasons for introducing a helium network are as follows.
1. In Korea, the government-centered LoRa gateway construction has been progressing. Therefore, there were difficulties in securing a budget and selecting a site.
2. For the epoch-making expansion of LoRa gateway construction, it was determined that the method through the helium network was the most effective.
3. I was interested in the complex solution method of the existing government LoRa gateway and helium network method, so I participated.
