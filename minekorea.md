## Summary

## Company Information (required)
* What is your company name?
# MineKorea INC.
* How long have you been in business? 
## 5years
* What kind of products have you created? 
## Mine Korea is a crypto mining company that specializes in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Deeper mining, and consults mining sites and distributes/sells crypto miners.
* How many have you sold? 
## over 20,000 ethereum miners and $2.26 million worth of sales with deeper connect miners.
* What brought you to Helium etc? 
## As a result of looking at the current status of helium miners, we have found that there are no helium miner manufacturers in Korea, and that Korean investors really want to do helium mining. Mine Korea currently operates a YouTube channel with more than 20,000 subscribers, and there are many investors who want to mine helium here, but they are experiencing the inconvenience of having to wait a over 6 months to receive helium miners. As a result,we want to make a perfect helium miner by partnering with the most professional company(True Networks Ltd.) related to Network devices in Korea with the idea of manufacturing and delivering helium miners ourselves. Mine Korea is a mining company that is preparing for a mining business related to web 3.0 beyond Ethereum mining. We are currently working as the official dealer of Deeper Network and as a file coin SPWG.

## Full Hotspot
* Is it for indoor or outdoor?
## for Both depending on housing.
* Provide a brief description of what you're making.
## Helium Hotspot miner

## What is your approximate price point? (required)
## around $1000usd
## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)

## Picture with indoor case
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. 
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 
## Developing Helium hotspot and specification as below.
1. MMIPS  architecture SBC 
2. Dual Core MT76221A processor.
3. 3 Gigabit ethernet port 
4. Mini PCI-e Lora module 910~920Mhz(for Korea) it can change for other countries
5. Mini PCI-e LTE module (for Korean Telco)
6. 256Mb Ram
7. 16Mb flash drive  +128G M.2 SATA SSD for Application and logging
8. Total 4 Antenna ( 2 for LTE, 1 for Lora, 1 for GNSS)
</br>
Software set-up plan:</br> 
We are thinking of constructing a software setup through the helium official app, and we don't know what functions we need because we haven't received the source code of helium yet. However, once we receive the code, it is possible to configure and develop hardware accordingly.

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline? (required)
## Ship out at 2Q 2022
## Previous shipments (required)
## It is our first time.
## Startups welcome! 
* Have you shipped anything in the past? 
## No
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 
## Mikrotik products are used world-widely with FCC and CE aaproved.
* Which countries do you plan to ship to? 
Korea

## Customer Support (required)
* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products? 
## Via our official Website and through 1:1 questionnaire service in our official community channel
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 
## 1 year official warranty but plan to regular life cycle around 3 years.


## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or no?
## no
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? 
## no
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
## yes
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?
## yes
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
## yes

## Hardware Information (required)
* Please let us know:

* Which security (swarm) element are you using? 
## AES256 accelerator
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs 
## At this moment we test SX1301 but will change to SX1302
* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
## from Latvia(Mikrotik) and China
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? .
## As many as we need

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
## We have outsourced them.
* Have you built gateways before?
## none
* How many gateways did you make?
## none
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
## We are receiving products through True Networks Ltd. True Networks Ltd has the exclusive dealearship of Mikrotik products in Korea , and the network-related equipment of Mikrotik distributed by True Networks Ltd. is widely used by Chinese manufacturers and distributors, and also thier  embedded products and network products are used for Korean government's security equipment.

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
## We expect about 5,000 units for the first order. However, we can supply more quantity at any time through a solid supply chain.
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to?
## Mine Korea will always hold 100% up-front payment because we sell products through a pre-order system. All of these payments are available because we have already received all the ã…”payment of the orders.
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures - getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 
## Mine Korea is not only planning to produce helium miners, but also doing many businesses at the same time. Ethereum Miner Consignment Business, Deeper Network Mining Consignment Business, Block Deal with Domestic Coin Exchange, and Laos Coin Exchange Business. We are already generating a lot of revenue through many businesses, and I don't there will be a problem in producing helium miners.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
## The biggest concern when we manufacture helium miners is that there are no cases of manufacturing helium miners in Korea yet, and the helium code is not an open source, so the device cannot be manufactured by applying it in advance. We will do our best with network experts to ensure that the helium network is fully operational on our device, but we are concerned that something might fall out in the middle. We want to unconditionally pass through hip19 and become a third-party manufacturer, and we are always open to feedback that the Helium Foundation can give us. We think Korea's coin market and mining market are very enthusiastic, calculating that the web 3.0 trend will come soon, investors in Korea are looking forward to our helium miners, It is not a problem to successfully launch helium devices in Korea, but I think full support from the Helium Foundation is needed to do so. Currently, Deeper Network's mining products, started selling since October, have generated sales worth about $2.26 million. Now is the right time to promote helium networks in Korea and configure many helium miners.
