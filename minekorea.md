## What brought you to Helium etc?

Minekorea is currently in full swing in the web3.0 cryptocurrency mining business. Starting with the Deeper Network and Filecoin mining, the distributed LoRa network through helium will likely be a big part of the IOT industry, so helium was thought to have a sufficient vision as web3.0 project. Minekorea currently operates a mining-related YouTube channel with more than 23,000 subscribers(https://www.youtube.com/user/blueviolate/), and we are receiving large sum of inquiries about helium mining from our viewers.  There are many individuals try to purchase helium miner overseas, but it takes at least six months to receive and these products are usually overseas models only which don't match the frequency band in Korea. There were some users who were mining with proper device. However, due to the nature of helium, moderate number of nodes have to be widely distributed to facilitate network communication to transmit data for more rewards. Thus, Minekorea is planning to facilitate distribution as a third-party manufacturer and build a wide LoRa network of helium. **We want to manufacture a perfect helium hotspot miner through partnerships with the nation's leading LoRa network and network hardware company, Mikrotik Korea.** Below is our partner company's web url.

## Manufacturing Information (required)

* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? Have you built gateways before? How many gateways did you make? 

  **Mikrotik Korea produces voice phishing detecting device and supplies them to the Korean police agency.**

* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

  **MINE HNT Miner will be produced by our partner company, Minkrotik Korea (also known as "True Networks").**

  **Mikrotik Korea is a network equipment company with a sole distributorship of MikroTik in Korea and is carrying out a variety of projects, including hardware sales and embeded program development. Intel's "NUCserver" is a brand independent of Truenetworks (Mikrotik Korea) and has been listed in Intel's partner solution directory and has been recognized for its technology. Currently, it supplies various security-related network hardware and programs to Korean government agencies and police agencies.**

  **As it has a strong supply chain to China and Latvia through years of security and network-related business operations, there will be no disruptions in supply and manufacturing MINE HNT Miners.**

* Where are you sourcing your components from? 

  **We will source parts through various manufacturers. LoRa module chips, which are key components, will be supplied through ebyte RAK, and other components will be supplied through various partner suppliers, including Mikrotik, 52pi in consideration of the supply and demand situation.**

* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 

  **No limit for this, it will be produced on demand**

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital (required)

* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales?

  **The initial sales plan is 3,000 units as a lot of inquiries are already coming in through our YouTube channel and SNS. Then, the 2nd sale will be carried out after the first sale and production go smoothly, and inventory sales are also being considered according to demand.**

* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 

  **There is no problem with the budget because the order is made through pre-sale. Even if orders do not exceed MOQ, Mine Korea has enough budget to cover these costs.**

* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures - getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 

  **Mine Korea is already generating profits through various mining businesses, and we believe that there will be no problem with funds because additional sales will be generated through the operation of Ethereum Classic Mining Pool/Filecoin Mining/Laos Mining Center, which start this year.**

## Risks & Challenges (required)

The biggest concern is the lack of parts supply. MikroTik Korea has been doing business with its partners for a long time, but the problem of chipset shortages worldwide could disrupt helium miner production. Therefore, we tried to configure the components that are relatively smooth to supply in the market.
