# Hotspot Manufacturers

Hub for Helium hotspot manufacturer applications and the Manufacturer Oversight Committee (MOC).

For details on the manufacturer approval process, please see [HIP19: Approval Process For Third-Party Manufacturers.](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

For a detailed walkthrough of how to submit your own application, please see [How to submit a Helium hotspot manufacturer application.](https://jamiedubs.com/blog/how-to-submit-helium-manufacturer-application/)

# Please use this [template](https://github.com/dewi-alliance/hotspot-manufacturers/blob/main/template.md) to make your proposal.

# Manufacturer Onboarding

We recommend getting into the Helium community discord as soon as possible and joining the conversation in the #hip-19-third-party-manufacturers channel. Establishing a trusted reputation among the community is critical to your success. Manufacturers are encouraged to provide an introduction and direct interested parties to your own communication channels (e.g. company email or support). It is of the utmost importance to appropriately manage expectations on your product, the cost, and production timelines. This information should be included in your application. 

Manufacturers who wish to participate in the Helium Network should complete the below steps (2-4 can be completed in parallel).

## Submit an Application 
 Overview of HIP19 (Manufacturer Approvals)
 Reach out to scott@dewi.org and sophi@dewi.org for KYC requirements
 
## Fees in USD (beginning August 2021)
 * HIP19 proposal (administrative costs for application review): $500
 * DeWi KYC: $1500
 * Hardware Audit: if using ECC608 for security: $3000. 
 * Hardware Audit: other security implementations: $4000
 
 Please ask sophi@dewi.org or scott@dewi.org for an invoice.
 
## Application Template
 Make a copy of the TEMPLATE.md file in this repository and put it in the same directory, i.e. 0019-third-party-manufacturers/name-of-your-company.md
 Fill it out; if you have questions or concerns about a particular question, ask on GitHub or on Discord. Many questions are required, and leaving blank will delay your application.
 Submit a pull request.
 Discussion and approval would follow the same "rough consensus” process used by HIPs generally, as outlined in HIP7.
 
## Send Hotspot for Hardware Audit 
 * Until further notice Helium Inc is continuing to perform the audit on behalf of the DeWi Alliance.
 * The fee for hardware audits is between $3000 and $4000 USD depending on the security implementation.
 * At a high level, the hardware audit includes the verification of: security methods, radio configurations, and the integration of Helium software, such as the Miner or the Light Gateway application.
 * More details about the hardware audit can be reviewed here. Please be sure to review this link as it tends to answer many of the auditing questions that we receive.
 * Please reach out to louis@helium.com and sophi@dewi.org to start this part of the process. 
 
## Complete Onboarding Integration 
 The onboarding integration ensures your hotspot will be recognized by the blockchain and Hotspot owners are able to appropriately provide proof of coverage and mine HNT.
 Instructions to add your hotspot to the Helium app and integrate with the onboarding server. 
 Please reach out to coco@helium.com to add a test hotspot to the onboarding server.
 Once you’ve successfully hit the API endpoint, you’ve completed this task.
 
## Complete Radio Certification
 FCC/CE/WPC or other applicable radio certification.
 Provide certification for the geography where you plan to take orders.
 
## Manufacturing Oversight Committee Approval
 This is the final step before DeWi provides its ‘stamp of approval’ ahead of a manufacturer taking pre-orders. 
 We complete this step for full transparency.
 If you’ve completed all the above steps and been available in the community discord chat to answer questions, you should have no concerns about receiving MOC approval. 

## Pre-Orders
 At this point, after MOC approval, you are in the best position to take pre-orders as you see fit.
 A wait-list is permitted if you are not collecting payments. If you need to collect payment as part of your wait-list, you should contact sophi@dewi.org so the matter can be addressed by the Manufacturing Oversight Committee.
