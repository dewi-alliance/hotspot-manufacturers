# **Name**

E-sun Electronics Ltd/ Panther X Light(Panther X L)

 

# **Summary**

E-sun Electronics understands the importance of a paradigm shift for decentralized wireless infrastructure powered by the Helium Blockchain. Therefore, we are delighted to become a third-party manufacturer and build high-efficiency full or light hotspots. Shortly, we aim to contribute to the connective grid for the helium network and develop and provide the tools and sensors to the business parties.
 

We submit a new proposal for the Panther X light (Panther X L) hotspot.

Yes

**● Have you built gateways before?**

Yes

**● How many gateways did you make?**

We have sold more than 70,000 pcs Panther X gateways in the past.

**●If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third-party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible, please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.**

# **Proof of Identity**

We submitted this information to Dewi via email in July.

 

# **Budget & Capital**

**● How many of these are you hoping to make and sell?**

We have sufficient funding support to produce the hardware in large volumes. Therefore, we aim to build at least 20000 pcs every month.

 **● How much money will be required up-front?**
 
 $1500,000
 
 **● How much money do you have on hand?**
 
 More than $2,000,000
 
 **● and how much do you have access to?**
 
 $1,000,000
 
 
  **●What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.**

  Our inventory sales can bring us more cash flow.

# **Risks & Challenges**

Sourcing components continue to be challenging in the current market; several supply chain issues affect the whole industry. There might be possible increased costs of components and shipments.
