## COMPANY NAME
KauZ LLC (Trimen LLC)

## Summary
Kauz LLC is a subsidiary of Trimen LLC, a company from the Ukraine that specializes in development,
production and serial production of devices observation and aiming with the introduction of modern technologies for armaments and military equipment.

We are proposing a new breed of secure Helium Hotspots (in this time outdoor. Indoor, light-gateways and periferal Helium equipment leather).

## Company Information
KauZ LLC is a subsidiary of Trimen LLC, Trimen LLC was founded in 2007.
Our company accumulated rich experience during our existence, created a good team of highly qualified specialists, developed and mastered a number of new technologies.
We are one of the few companies capable of developing, designing, building, put into operation various devices, appliance and systems and provide them in-depth integration.
Our head office and production facilities are located in Kiev, Ukraine, however, we guarantee a stable output of products even
in the conditions of war with a heavy enemy - the Russian Federation.
Trimen is a leading manufacturer of devices and equipment.
We are planning to produce Helium gateway and periferal equipment as Kauz LLC. Because the military direction and the civil one must be legally separated.
Kauz LLC uses the same production lane as Trimen LLC. In fact, this is one and the same company, only different names.

Helium is a bold take on IoT and blockchain/crypto, we see the potential and value of Helium.
In our opinion Helium is the first blockchain trying to solve something that is a real struggle. 

## Product Information
We are building a new breed of gateways that are more attractive and more compact, strong and stable, like Ukraine itself
in the war with the Russian Federation.

- Dimension, H x W x B, mm:
- Case including antenna connector: 180 x 85 x 29
- With connected antenna set (including LoRa antenna): 410 x 140 x 29.

Our software is custom and will include OTA updates for the lifetime of the device, encompassing useful features in addition to the original features.
The main direction our company's activities are development, production and serial production of devices observation and aiming with the
introduction of modern technologies for armaments and military equipment.
The company has all the features technologies and rights to intellectual property (developments are protected relevant patents).
During our work we have achieved results that significantly improve combat possibilities of samples of armaments and equipment where our
devices development and production are used.
We are able to produce 10,000 units a month. Our first batch will be scheduled for delivery by the end of May 2022.
Trimеn has been supplying its products for many years. We plan to supply Hotspots all over the world, except for the
Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus.
In addition to the fact that we will not sell our products to users from the Russian Federation and the
Republic of Belarus, we blocked the frequency range of the Russian Federation - RU865 and blocked the ability to run
the miner software when signing geolocation from the above territories to the blockchain at any frequencies,
since EU868 frequencies operate in the Republic of Belarus.
We call on the Helium community and other manufacturers to support this initiative and prevent the above countries
from helping to support the financing of armed aggression against Ukraine and threats around the world. 

## Previous shipments
We have experience in exporting products to other countries, the products we exported do not require approval by regulatory authorities such as FCC, CE and the like, they were regulated by more stringent requirements. 

## Which countries do you plan to ship to and get regulatory certifications for
First of all, in those regulated by the FCC and CE, in parallel we will receive regulatory certificates for the
UK, Scandinavia, Canada, Australia, the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea,
a little later for India and China (depending on their position - neutrality or support Russian Federation and Republic of Belarus).

## Customer Support
Customer support will be handled via Discord, email and via our dashboard. We plan on providing support and updates for the lifetime of the product.
Repairs/Replacements will be handled domestically:
If the device is defective due to our manufacturing process or shipping/mishandeling on our part we will immediately ship a replacement out.
If the device/one of modules is defective due to user mishandeling/error we will provide repair or ship-out a replacement part for a price.
This includes case, concentrator, compute module, motherboard, charger, antenna set. 

## Hardware Security Element
Our gateway has an ATECC608 encryption chip which is originally used.
Because of this, you will face three main challenges when implementing secure authentication on a LoRaWAN network:
Protecting the symmetric keys both in the network backend and at the edge node;
Overcoming the manufacturing logistics of securely shipping and distributing the physical keys into millions of edge nodes;
Preventing attackers who will be taking advantage of this known security weakness from accessing keys and exploiting your system;
To overcome these challenges, you can strengthen the authentication process by implementing a secure hardened key storage both at the node and in the LoRaWAN backend.
This prevents the exposure of authentication keys to software, firmware, manufacturing sites, end users and other third parties.
We use ATECC608 as the swarm keys issued by Helium.
The sharing of prototype for adult result could be further discussed and arranged.
Samples can be provided to DeWi and/or Helium and be submitted to any tests.

## Manufacturing Information
We have own the factory manufacturing our products we manufacture and supervise manufacturing for various products, and ensured the highest quality product.
We have been manufacturing and distributing our own brand products for over 12 years and work with a number of trusted manufacturing partners.
We will use these trusted partners for the Helium gateways so as not to introduce any unknowns into the manufacturing process.
We also have strong relationships with a variety of electronics component suppliers and will use these relationships to ensure we have resilience in our supply chain. 

## Proof of Identity
Submitted privately to DeWi. 

## Budget & Capital
We intend to proceed with a first batch of 5000 to 10000 pcs but we can scale this up should the pre-order demand require it.
We have secured all the capital needed in order to bring the first batch to market.
By owning factory production delays due to lack of capital will not be an issue.
Our factory is continuously running and stable and profitable. 

## Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge that we see is the production of SX1303, and the availability of raspberry Pi’s.
We have tested the electronics design thoroughly already and the core LoRaWAN hardware had been well proven by us and our customers over the last few years.
We also have a lot of experience with manufacturing our own hardware, so we don't anticipate any issues.
The packaging design and all other aspects of the project are nearly finalised.
He biggest challenge that we see is the production of SX1303 (SX1303 + 2 pcs. SX1250 + SX1261).
We think that with good management these issues are not going to pose a problem and not cause delays.
We intend to order/manufacture 30% more than we actually need in order to satisfy repairs and not hinder future production.
Fortunately the manufacturer we are working with is one we have successfully used many times before and we know and trust they can deliver to schedule.
As an established and busy e-commerce business Trimen are easily capable of handling the shipping burden of this project and have all the frameworks
in place to achieve this quickly and efficiently.
We will be using DHL, UPS,FeDeX for our shipping and the shipping is fully insured and tracked.
With current component availability, a 10000 unit batch of boards would take about 8 to 10 weeks to produce.
We will place the first production order immediately when we get manufacturer approval.
