No.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
Yes.

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 
We have R&D ability to develop our own App to setup the devices.
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? 
ECC608
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs.) 
SX1302
* What is the CPU?
Cortex.
* Additional Hardware Specifications: 
Undetermined.

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
Yes.
* Have you built gateways before? 
Yes.
* How many gateways did you make? 
10 Thousand.
