## What is your approximate price point? 790 USD

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos - we will provide some photos and video, but consider it is just a draft prototype and not proffesional media materials at this moment. We will add more in the next days.
The software is the same used by Syncrobit, so we will have all their features and probably more.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality, and how you might address them.
The first challenge is the time we need until we got your approval as a vendor. That's why we are ready with all the components to get in production when we have the approval.
We have the components for the first 1000 gateways in stock and we are getting in touch with suppliers for another 2000. The risk is to have the price increased and to remain out of stock if this first sale is going too long.
