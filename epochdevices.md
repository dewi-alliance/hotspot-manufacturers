For possible malfunctioning products, we will have spare parts on stock to exchange rapidly the defects.


## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware.
No.
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. 
Yes
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
No, but potting could be added for securing the ECC608 if necessary

* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) 
Yes

## Hardware Information (required)
* Please let us know:

* Which security (swarm) element are you using? 
ECC608
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway
SX1303 & SX1250s

* Where are you sourcing your components from?
Mouser, Farnell, Ineltro, Avnet, Digikey, TME, China distributors, etc

* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?
We have in stock 1000 pcs and we are ready to buy another 2000.

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
Yes
* Have you built gateways before?
Yes
* How many gateways did you make?
no more than 300, but more complicated.

* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
We produce the gateways.

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.

We have a 350.000 USD budget for the first batch. We have the whole money, no loans needed.

* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.
No need for additional financing. We could go further until 600 000 USD if necessary.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality, and how you might address them.
The first risk is decreasing the demand for these Gateways if more and more vendors come. We want to quicly be approved to start the production. We work with on stock pieces to sell only what is secure for delivery.
The second risk is some out of stock for few electronic parts: SX1303, SX1250 or Raspberry Pi. We blocked some, but we cannot do this on an unlimited period, so we need to move fast.
