Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19

## Summary

Glad to be back to HIP19 again!

Jitong Electric offers carrier-grade IoT management-platform and all-in-one IoT solutions. With competitive supply chain and strong R&D team, Jitong Electric designs and manufactures ranges of innovative, high-performance IoT gateways. Its first model indoor Hotspot XR-Wireless has been integrated to Helium Network successfully. Considering outdoor Hotspot is needed to make Helium network’s deployment more effective, we designed another full Hotspot for outdoor use, its model name is XR-Wireless1.

## Company Information

Xi'an Jitong Electric Co., Ltd. was established in 2009 and is headquartered in Xi'anXi'an Jitong Electric Co., Ltd. Focus on the production and manufacturing of Internet of things equipment, R & D and production of Internet of things water dispenser, Internet of things door lock, local physical network and various communication modules

As an existing manufacturer of Hotspot, we will keep investing in research and development to improve the ECO system of People’s network.

## Product Information 

XR-Wireless  product portfolio consists of IoT modules, LoRa gateways, node devices and all-in one solutions.They offer high quality, outstanding radio performances and carrier-grade security, and support US915, AU915, AS923, EU868, IN865, RU867, CN470 etc.. Please consult https://www.xajtdq.com/ for the full product list.

We have recently developed a new outdoor gateway compatible with Helium network. This product is named as XR-Wireless Miner.

Like our Smart LoRa Gateways, Helium Hotspot X5 Miner features:  

* Pwered byXilinx FPGA Serial XC7Z010, 128M internal flash

* Comes with a LoRa gateway processor SX1302&SX1303

* Power Over Ethernet Connectivity

* WiFi IEEE802.11a/b/g/n

* Bluetooth connectivity

* Frequency band: 470MHz/868MHz/915MHz/923MHz and others

* Coverage radius: 5km in city, 10km in rural area

* Voltage DC 12V 

* IP67 level waterproof and dust-proof case

* Comes with ECC Key to securely store swarm keys


## Approximate price point

Our outdoor Hotspot X5 price range is between 500-550usd according to the order quantity.

## Hardware designs, including relevant parts

Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 

## Expected production and delivery timeline?

Lead time for bulk order will be 3-4 months


## Startups welcome!

We are going to open Europe, USA and Chinese market with XR-Wireless outdoor full Hotspot.

## Customer Support

We will handle the after-sales issues with online upgrades through the lifetime of products. This model will have online upgrade and maintaining dashboard from web, it also supports OTA and APP BLE configuration.

About repairs and replacements within warranty period of 1year:

If the device is defective due to our manufacturing process shipping/mishandling on our part we will immediately offer a new replacement free of charge.

If the device/one of modules is defective due to user mishandling/error we could repair or arrange ship-out a replacement part at a reasonable price. This includes case, raspberry pi motherboard, power supply and antenna.



## Hardware Security Element

Currently we are planning the following:

* Our XR-Wireless full Hotspot gateways will store their swarm_key on an ECC chip as requested.In the case of operating system got corrupted,that the user could recover their miner easily.
* We will be more than happy to submit prototypes for audit. For future products we are Consistently evaluating more options including othre secuity element chips

## Hardware Information

* The mainboard is Xilinx FPGA and LoRa module processor is SX1302&SX1303.
* We are using ECC608(swarm) chip for sercurity element.
* We can procure from Semtech 10K-100k SX1302 chipset in 2021.

## Manufacturing Information

Xi'an Jitong Electric Co., Ltd. Invested significantly in R&D and A large number of intelligent IOT modules are launched for various projects every year, including the application of smart home, intelligent IOT Park, intelligent physical network and greenhouse.

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately to DeWi.We have finished KYC by first time application for our indoor Hotspot.

## Budget & Capital

We aim to produce 5000 pcs XR-Wireless Miner hotsports as our first batch, then steadily provide 1000 units each month.Xi'an Jitong Electric have sufficient funds to produce large volumes. 

## Risks & Challenges 

The greatest challenge in our opinion is that the supply chain of SX1302&SX1303 with price volatility currently. We will solve it with a rich running stock.
