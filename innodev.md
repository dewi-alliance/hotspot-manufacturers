### Estimated Price point
Estimated price is 600 Euro ex. VAT being dedicated for special outdoor conditions
 
 
### Functionalities
When we designed this device, we had in mind its outdoor usage and the consequences arising from this. Our own imposed requirements take in consideration some of the most restrictive usage scenarios like easy and fast installation outdoors on existing telecommunication poles in the city or transportation infrastructure (city roads, highways, railways subway stations etc.)
Some of the key features of this device are:
 
 
-   IP68 by design
-   Compact form factor – cylindrical (6x20 cm) aluminum case
-   Power supply – PoE only
-   Passive cooling – electronic modules are immersed into a special cooling liquid
-   No moving parts.
-   No physical buttons
-   RF module, CPU module and cooling liquid temperature monitoring and protection.
-   RGB light signaling via translucent enclosure caps
 
 
### High Level Design
The device is composed from the following main modules:
 
 
1.  RF module - Innodev LWTERR-RF which is our own made mPCIe Lora module around Semtech SX1303 chip. However for initial lower volumes we will use the mPCIe Lora module from a different manufacturer (same Semtech SX1303 design)
2.  Mainboard – Innodev LWTERR-MB that contains all other power, security, thermal management, communication, gps and security components
3.  Raspberry PI ComputeModule 4 with BLE and EMMC memory. In the future for the next revision we plan to develop our own module using ARM or RISC V cpu.
4.  Enclosure – sealed aluminum enclosure with IP68 RJ48 and N-type connectors including internal cooling liquid

**Figure 8 - High Level Architecture**
 
### Electronic Modules
-   RF module – LWTERR-RF
-   Mainboard module – LWTERR-MB
-   RPI CM4 with BLE and EMMC
   
### Software
The software is composed from the following main modules:
-   Semtech Forwarder and HAL
-   Helium miner – docker
-   Mainboard aux kernel and service modules – thermal management, RGB LED control, ECC chip, all via I2C
-   Management interface using Django with docker
-   The Helium configuration application (/gateway-config) to support communication with the Innodev Hotspot App
 
![FigureConfigWeb](https://github.com/egtogamat/hotspot-manufacturers/blob/main/applications/innodev/Internal%20WEB%20config%20app.JPG)
 
**Figure 9 - Internal WEB configuration app**
 
 
**System upgrade**
The gateway will permit the following upgrade methods:
-   Automatic via Internet – for entire system or for specific docker images or software
-   Manual via Internet - for entire system or for specific docker images
-   Manual only in service via USB – for entire system
 
 
**System daily updates check**
-   Updates for the miner
 
 
**Configuration management**
 
 
The device configuration is aggregated in a single .conf type file. Via web interface, the user can save a backup of the file or upload a backup one.
As we specified earlier, the gateway is designed to work outdoors, mostly installed to 3 or more meters high. Users should also avoid open enclosure, being sealed and filled with thermal conducting liquid. Another reason is an operational one. Being installed most probably in a high position, the user could just power-off and power-on the device by disconnecting the ethernet cable, and place the beacon in the device proximity. The device status and reset procedure will be signalized by the LED light color and blinking of the bottom cap.
### Production and delivery timeline
1.  Prototypes – 10pcs of full functioning prototypes are produced, and two of them will be sent to Helium for certification
2.  First batch – 100pcs until September depending of Helium certification duration, using our own resource, and not relying on pre orders
3.  We estimate that we can produce one batch each 3 months starting with 200+ devices/batch but this figure can be increased depending of orders and component availability
See Figure 1
 
 
## Previous shipments
 
* Have you shipped anything in the past?
 
Yes, we have shipped around 2000+ devices with different 
 
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 
 
We have shipped CE approved products to Romania which, as part of the European Union, has mandatory CE requirements. 
 
* Which countries do you plan to ship to? 
 
We plan to ship to all countries in Europe, for starters. After that we plan to expand to worldwide shipping.
 
Here are more details about our answers.
 
We shipped various equipment and turned key solutions. Until now we targeted custom made solutions for our customers, mostly industrial, not consumer ones.
We shipped only in the EU. Starting with the prototyping we will provide CE approval for them. First batches of production will be made only for Europe and countries that use 868Mhz band and where CE approval is sufficient. Later on, we will consider producing the RF modules for 915Mhz and apply for FCC approval.
 
 
## Customer Support
 
* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products?
 
We will offer customer support by phone and online (email ticket and Discord channel)
 
* For how long? 

Support will be available for the entire life duration of the product. 
 
* How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements?

Repairs and replacements will be executed in our factory in Romania.
 
 
Below are more details regarding our answers.
 
 
Our product will be ISO 9001:2015 Quality management standard compiled. We will establish a clear customer support procedure by phone and online (email ticket and Discord channel - #terranium). We will have a dedicated team for support available from Monday to Friday - from 9AM to 5PM CET). The team and working hours will be upgraded based on the equipment delivery quantities and regions. Romania has a well established reputation on the market for professional technical customer support for major companies like Ericsson, Oracle). We will offer support in the following languages: English, French, Spanish and Romanian.
 
 
The warranty will be for 1 year with the possibility to be extended. In the warranty period, our first option will be the replacement. The repairing procedures will be done by Innodev. User will send the equipment to our service office for this procedure. Due to the fact that all electronic modules will be immersed in a liquid, the repairing procedure requires special tools and skills.
 
 
For the replacement and repair, the RaspberryPi Compute Module and the mPCIE radio board offer flexible and fast repair time.
When needed (main board damage) and posible, we will move the ECC chip to the new device so the user will keep the same swarm key and device settings
 
 
As part of the European Union we can ensure fast delivery time to all EU countries without any delays due to custom clearance, both for initial purchases and also for service returns.
 
 
## Hardware Security Element
 
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
 
The firmware will be locked-down to the serial number of the processor. The data will be encrypted as use BalenaOS
 
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, using the ATECC608B ECC chip
 
Swarm key and data encryption key will be stored in the ECC chip.
 
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
 
Tampering will be mittigated by adding sensors to the board.
 
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)
 
We plan on submitting the prototype for auding in July.
 
 
Below are more details regarding our answers.
 
 
The hardware root of trust of the gateway is an ATECC608B chip. This is a secure authenticator, compliant ECDSA, to ensure signature generation and verification to support a bidirectional asymmetric key authentication model.
The swarm_key files are stored in the ECC chip to ensure the highest grade of security.
 
 
In order to mitigate the scarcity of the ECC608 chips the board is designed to accommodate 2 different ECC chips from 2 different manufacturers. The software contains drivers for both chips.
 

Tampering attempts will be detected by measuring the right cooling liquid level and temperature of those 3 sensors.
 
 
## Hardware Information
 
* Which security (swarm) element are you using?
 
We use the ATECC608B chip as security element.
 
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway?
 
We use the SX1303 and SX1250 with our own radio board design.
 
* Where are you sourcing your components from?
 
Our supplier are located in UK, European Union and China.
 
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?
 
We can procure at least 1000 SX1303 and SX1250 mPCIe modules.
 
 
Below are more details regarding our answers.
 
 
**Security element**
An ATECC608B chip is used to securely store the swarm_key. The board supports 2 different ECC chips from 2 different manufactures: ATECC608B and DS28C36
 
**LoRa module**
We will use the mPCIe module reference design by Semtech. We will aquire the already built module from a supplier based in Germany.
When we will increase the yearly production we will start using the LoRa module designed and produced by us. It is a mPCIe module, and uses SPI and GIO for communication. We use the SX1303 & SX1250 in order to take advantage of the Fine Timestamp capability of this chipset and implement higher accuracy location services in the future. This mPCIe radio module is designed by us, and produced in factories in China and, as backup,  Germany. There are other LoRa mPCIe modules on the market but we prefer to produce our own, in order to decrease the dependency from other partners and avoid procurement risks. We can produce RF modules as much as we need according to the orders. Components for it will be procured from different distribution partners from the UK, Romania and China.
 
 
**CPU Module**
TERRANIUM gateway uses a RaspberryPi Compute Module 4 with EMMC and BLE. We have a distribution partner in the UK for this component.
 
 
**Mainboard module**
The mainboard is fully designed by Innodev. As described above in High Level Design and Figure 4, it contains the connectors for LoRa module and RPI CM4, GPS module and includes all other functional components like thermal management, power management and PoE, RBG LED signaling, Ethernet Phy and USB. For the PCB and assembly, we have a good partnership with a factory in Bulgaria. The components will be acquired from our distribution partners from the UK and Romania.
 
 
**Enclosure**
Enclosure is designed by Innodev. It has a cylindrical form made from aluminum and translucent plastic caps for RGB light status signaling. Inside is filled with the cooling liquid. It is a special liquid used to cool electronic devices that are immersed into it. It has good temperature conductivity but an electric isolator. Its role is to transfer the heat from the electronic components to the aluminum enclosure body. The temperature of this liquid will cross a programmable limit, it will stop the power of the CPU and RF module. It will enable power only after the temperature decreases.
Mechanical processing will be made in Romania by a specialized factory.
 
 
**Final assembly and automatic testing** will be done by us, in our own production warehouse. It is already finalized in Bucharest and will be equipped for production processes.
 
 
**MTBF analysis**
The MTBF analysis and simulations will be performed for the electronic modules that we produce and for the device itself.
 
 
## Manufacturing Information
 
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
 
Yes, we have built ZigBee products.
 
* Have you built gateways before?
 
Yes, we have built ZigBee gateways and Ethernet gateways.
 
* How many gateways did you make? 
 
We produced around 2000 gateways. 
 
 
Below are more details regarding our answers.
 
 
Our experience includes working with technologies like  Zigbee, BLE and GSM. We designed and produced gateways used in different IoT industrial applications like:
-   ZigBee to Ethernet/IP (MQTT)
-   ZigBee to GSM/IP (MQTT)
-   BLE to WIFI/IP (MQTT)
-   IP(MODBUS) to Ethernet/IP (MQTT and REST API)
-   Serial (MODBUS) to Ethernet/IP (MQTT and REST API)
 
In order to reduce the risk for delays in hardware production:
- we have design our own radio board with the latest radio chips available (SX1303 and SX1250)
- we are in contact with 3 board manufacturers in 3 different countries (China, Germany and Bulgaria)
- we have 3 supply chains in 3 different countries/regions (UK, European Union, China)
- final assembly and enclosure manufacturing is done in Romania 
 
## Proof of Identity
 
 
Innodev SRL is a private company with four private shareholders. Detailed information can be provided by request.
 
 
## Budget & Capital
 
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
 
We plan to start with a small batch (100) without any pre orders. After that we plan higher production batches (200-3000 devices/batch)
 
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to?
 
We have the money on-hand to produce 100 gateways and finance the software development, customer support and testing.
 
*  What is your plan for additional financing if required? 
 
 
Below are more details regarding our answers.
 
 
Innodev funds come from the consultancy services we provide so we have large profit margin. All shareholders can contribute to funding this projects as all shareholders have other sources of income.
 
-   Prototype batch – 10 devices
-   First batch – 100 devices founded by us with existing company founds with no additional financing    
-   Production batches - 3 to 4 batches per year starting with 200 - 3000 devices / batch.
 
 
We plan to accept pre-orders only for 868Mhz models for the Production batches. Our intention is that half of each batch to be financed by us, not from pre-orders to ensure a device buffer for warranties, repair & service and direct sales.
 
 
## Risks & Challenges
 
 
There are a series of risks that we identified and we have to mitigate. Most important are:
1.  Electronic component shortage – some components can not be found easily or in a high number. It is a case for some ICs, resonators, filters but also for some capacitors. In order to mitigate this risk we took some measures like establish equivalent components if it is possible, add additional footprint on PCB for a different replacement component but not pin compatible and establish a list with more suppliers from different regions ( EU, UK, US and Asia)
2.  Production delays – we could face some delays on module production ( PCB and assembly). To mitigate this risk, we have three partners for production in three different countries (Germany, Bulgaria and China). With all of them we have good past experiences and we plan to split the batches or modules between them.
3.  Logistic issues - for various reasons, like epidemic risk escalation or high over logistic companies, delays in the logistic process could appear. To mitigate this risk, we will create partnerships with at least two global logistic companies and one local for Romania and nearby countries. At least one of them will be able to keep spare devices in their own warehouses for fast delivery for special cases like urgent replacements.
4.  Support service overload - if the delivery will increase, the risk of overloading the support team is high. Starting with the second production batch, we will establish a partnership with a specialised company in Romania for international support services. Locally in Bucharest and also in other major cities, there are well known companies specialized for multilanguage technical and sales support, so we can gradually make knowledge transfer to them.
5.  Financing issues - production cost could be an issue. This risk will be minimised through some measures:
        a.  We will establish an internal budget for the production to support the first batch and at least half of the following ones. Sources of financing are internally, factoring and investors
        b.  Using bank financial tools like trade finance and invoice finance
        c.  Acquisition of high component quantities
7.  Component obsolescence - from the design phase we select only components recommended for new designs. Anyhow, if any of the components will be obsolete, it can be replaced by a similar one, and the design (PCB layout, schematics, firmware) can be changed if needed.
8.  Reliability issues - MTBF calculations and simulation will be performed for each module and for the device. Our target is to exceed 10 years. This is one of the reasons that we choose to use the EMMC variant and not SD.
