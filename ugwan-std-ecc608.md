# uGWAN (Amber-Link)

## Summary

'uG' is named as user generated, we called uGWAN as user generated Wide-Area Network.

By powered with Helium blockchain protocol, 'uG' products will upgrade to fully compatiable with Helium Network, including hotspot, multi-type environment sensor, aged care security devices, asserts tracking tags, etc.

## Company Information
**Amber-Link** founded at Shanghai Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in 2016. We focus on smart city, aged care security, assert tracking and environment sensor business for 5+ years. Design and deploy LoRaWAN hotspots with cable carrier operator, stat grid, local community together in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guizhou, etc.

## Budget & Capital
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
  3K in Mar., >10K/month after mass production
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
  Have funded USD 3M for Helium Hotspot project kick-off, may increase invest to USD 5M depends on market.
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures - getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 
  So far, will control the budget with USD 5M.



## Risks & Challenges

- Concentrate IC: closely work with Semtech and set the pre-paid order in Dec already.
- Security IC: Microchip ATECC608 is shortage in market.
