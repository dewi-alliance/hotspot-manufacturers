## Shenzhen Coship Electronics Co., Ltd. was established in 1994. It is a high-tech enterprise that focuses on provision of leading smart-home products and services to global customers. In 2006, it successfully listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange (002052.SZ) and became the first listed company specializing in digital video in China. Coship has a digital-video development team of 500 and next to 2,000 patents in digital video (half of them are invention patents). It was first in the industry to open the Enterprise Postdoctoral Research Workstation and also established the National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Network Convergent Multimedia Interactive Technology. It has a digital-video industrialization base with an annual output of 20 million units and a vast industrialization experience. Its self-developed interactive platform supporting smart home solutions and services has covered most provinces and cities of China. Its off-the-shelf products are available in the international market and are exported to Europe, Middle East, South-East Asia, North America, South America, Australia, and North Africa and became internationally renowned brands. As an industry leader, Coship participated in drafting of 70 % of national broadcasting standards, is the Deputy Leader Unit of the China Next Generation Broadcasting Network (NGB) Work Group and of the China Smart TV Operating System (TVOS) Work Group. After years of rapid development, Coship has built the smart-home ecosystem industry chain of platform + content + applications + terminals + services. The core of its ecosystem are terminal, middleware, smart-platform, and operational-activity products. In broadcasting, Coship is the only provider to offer mature smart-home solutions and services. It will comprehensively promote the development of broadcasting to become a smart-home operator and will boost the development of the global digital-video industry. We are preparing to build Indoor Light Hotspots.

## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email the Helium Foundation (christina@helium.foundation).

* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No? Yes.

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.
