## Summary

Radon Tech LLC is an iOT company with scope in LATAM and a global vision that identifies and understands the problems and needs of companies that rollout and deploy iOT to the field. https://radon.tech/

With a management vision, the company focuses on the creation of new functional, practical and -above all- innovative proposals that tackles the changing difficulties suffered by users to install, monitor and preserve iOT networks including Helium. Opens a new concept of highly customizable hotspots tailored to each user and industry.

  ### Introducing our good looking **Hepox** hotspot (helium-proof-of-coverage-survivor)

For interiors and exteriors that offers facilities for its installation, applicable to all kinds of conditions, with a modular base and high design value that exhibits an innovative lighting system. The lightning system, including a protocol, the SAI Protocol (Status Activity Interface) aims to indicate activity and status of the hotspot at a glance from everywhere (even from and apps), allowing a friendly and practical monitoring of one or more hotspots. Leading to a manageable fleet of hotspots and nodes.   

The company looks forward to meeting the demands of the alliance as well as those of the market, adding value towards a future of rapid impact in which it wants to be a part of.

## Company Information 

Radon Tech was founded in 2021 by a network of partners with strong profiles in the industry who made their mining experiences with a 
project. Like a heavy gas that falls to earth at every vertical IoT, Radon aims to work on the ground.



Radon Tech's core team has a strong design, communications and hardware component, associated for this adventure with companies that make up the proposal such as  Emwicon https://www.emwicon.com/ (manufacturing Taiwan), Arsulta http://www.arsultra.com/ (satellites Argentina) and Elsys https://www.elsys.com.br/ (channel Brazil) starting sales operations in LATAM (Brazil and Argentina). Conforming a robust R&D team capable of designing and manufacturing custom hardware from state-of-the-art electronics to futuristic and good-looking casing.

Radon Tech LLC is a new venture with a senior and experienced team and partners that we co-develop including Emwicon company with 5 years of experience manufacturing iOT, LoraWan and Wifi products among others including: 

| Product              | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| WiFi (200K/Year)     | Card module and AP / Router / Repeater         |
| IOT  (50K/Year)      | Wireless IP Camera and Smart Asset Tracker with Temperature & Humidity sensor for Indoor & Outdoor Microzone |
| Medical (1K/Year)    | Harmonic Analysis                              |
| Power                | Wireless charger AirFuel Specification:BSS 1.3 Class 3   |

An ATM network in the US from the financial sector brought us to Helium. 

The intent of mining inside ATM’s led to the creation of the Radon Network project https://radon.network, our initial venture with mining. Oriented to B2B, it has served us as a massive laboratory for learning Helium goods and bads. Main reason why Radon Tech strategy is and will always be user based. The mining project's spearhead is a software program called Console that handles rewards for associates and users, allowing a true business environment.

### Modular design

Hepox is designed to be modular in several ways. From the point of view of the installation, it can be placed in various contexts and scenarios. Its base makes it versatile, it can be applied to a square or round spout, by or on a wall and with the absence of the base for an indoor state.

![base sola persp 1 25 5 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/172923736-88926393-61ee-4db6-b85c-30e5beef7816.png)
![render montaña 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/172924162-092e1158-55a9-4da4-8714-fb0b0395a4e5.png)
![render ciudad 3 25 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/172924315-95a99660-3e3d-472e-830c-234069898e15.png)

Likewise, the connector panel for buttons, SIM and cable is also modular, being able to expand or modify the number of connectors. The carrier plate can also be modified in case of expanding the connectors.

![ht dtella placa atras 1 25 5 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1870084/172927467-42d6cf24-5717-4bc4-82b5-ca55ceb5db87.png)

In terms of design the modularity also respects the faceted lines that are linked to technology, satellital, spacial. Samwise the lights are linked to crypto. All the aesthetics and beauty of the hotspot is designed to be desirable, attractive and to transmit values to robustness, confidence and power. Aimed at a user who consumes state of the art products and who is in love with their devices.

## Manufacturing Information 

Our partner manufacturer company Emwicon https://www.emwicon.com/ in Taiwan built and delivered radio hardware products as well as gateways, over 10 models.

* WiFi Gateway
* BT Gateway
* LTE Gateway 
* WiSUN Gateway
* RF(433) Gateway

Besides, also built IoT and communication devices like wifi, sensors for Industrial and commercial applications.
Emwicon is located in Taiwan that has become a strategic place for manufacturing due due to the situation that the post-pandemic world is going through and the Ukraine-Russia war, the importance of alignment with a supply chain that is aligned with the interests of the US and its allies, Taiwan plays an important role in the technological part, that is why the decision to manufacture it in Taiwan or Southeast Asia tomorrow. Therefore, the company is sourcing components from Taiwan and American accounts for 80%.

Emwicon has self-development capabilities of radio module, cooperative chip manufacturers: Realtek , Atheros , Qualcomm , WiSun , NXP, etc. Customer requests like Raspberry Pi , ESP, etc.

In addition, Google, Apple and other major American and European brands that manufacture or have manufactured their products in China are already withdrawing from China to produce in Taiwan and Southeast Asia such as Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Malaysia.


## Proof of Identity

To be submitted in private. 

## Budget & Capital 

We are manufacturing up to 30k units within the first six months of sales. We have a 1M budget, 100k in-hand for the first prototype production.
 

## Risks & Challenges 

The main challenge for  the supply of the components would be to acquire the critical components on time, in the right way at an adequate price, given the current situation in the supply chain, we have great challenges to obtain the components on time and at the price that we want. There are components that have a long delivery time of up to 50 weeks for example. Keeping tight control of inventory and production cost became even more unpredictable than in the pre-Covid era. 

There are also risks and challenges around innovation. Hepox hotspot is innovative, modern and futuristic breaking the mold of classic squared box hotspot adding lightning interaction, customization and modularity. As with all innovation processes, early adopters and especially community enthusiasts will set the path for acceptance. It is the spirit of this company to set a high innovation set for coming years expanding the business and products with your philosophy.
