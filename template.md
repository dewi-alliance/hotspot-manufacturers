## YOUR NAME

Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19. All questions must be answered. Any missing information will result in delays.
## Summary

## Company Information (required)
* What is your company name?
* How long have you been in business? 
* What kind of products have you created? 
* How many have you sold? 
* What brought you to Helium? 

## Product Information (required)
* What is this product's model name or model number? 
* Is this is Light Hotspot or Full Hotspot? (please submit two separate applications for Full and Light hotspots)
* Is it for indoor or outdoor?
* Provide a brief description:

## What is your approximate price point? (required)

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. 
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline? (required)

## Previous shipments (required)

## Startups welcomed!
* Have you shipped anything in the past? Yes or No
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 

## Which countries do you plan to ship to and get regulatory certifications for? (required)

## Customer Support (required)
* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products? 
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 


## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or no?
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? 
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?

## Hardware Information (required)
* The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email DeWi (christina@dewi.org).
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? 
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs 
* What is the CPU?
* Other Hardware Specifications: 

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
* Have you built gateways before? 
* How many gateways did you make? 
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales? 
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) 

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
