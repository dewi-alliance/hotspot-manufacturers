# **Proof of Identity**

We submitted this information to DeWi via email in July.

 

# **Budget & Capital**

**● How many of these are you hoping to make and sell?**

We have sufficient funding support to produce the hardware in large volumes. Therefore, we aim to build at least 20000 pcs every month.

**● How much money will be required up-front?**

$1500,000
 
**● How much money do you have on hand?**

More than $2,000,000
 
**● and how much do you have access to?**

$1,000,000
 
**● What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.**

Our inventory sales can bring us more cash flow.

# **Risks & Challenges**

Sourcing components continue to be challenging in the current market; several supply chain issues affect the whole industry. There might be possible increased costs of components and shipments.
