## Atom Design and Innovation

Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19

## Summary

Our mission is to develop community networks in Africa. We would like to empower engineers, entrepreneurs, and social innovators to enable shared value and solve sustainability challenges. In partnership with the Institute for Technology and Society we aim to make a significant positive difference in our local communities.

## Company Information
Atom Design and Innovation (Pty) Ltd was established in 2021. It is based in South Africa with an office in Paarl. The team consists of highly skilled and experienced engineers in the IOT industry. This company was established to design, manufacture and service existing IOT devices. The mission of this company is to build community networks by utilising the Helium network and combining this with existing devices via the LoRa network.

## Product Information
Our main product areas are in IoT modules, LoRa gateways and node devices. We have over 30 IoT related products currently in active production.
We are busy prototyping our own Full Hotspot and our device will be called the Proton Hotspot Miner. The main features of the Proton can be viewed below.
The Proton Hotspot Miner is a brand new, high-performance, ready-to-use LoRaWAN indoor gateway powered by the Helium LongFi™ Network. Helium provides miles of wireless network coverage and data transmission capacity for LoRaWAN devices. 

The key features of the Proton gateway will be discussed in detail. 

In the future we will also be investigating a solar solution for the Proton Hotspot Miner to target rural areas who can benefit from IoT devices. In some cases, mining will not be possible, due to power and/or access to internet constraints. In these cases, we will be able to provide these communities with a hotspot, purely to capture and transfer data from IoT devices.


## What is your approximate price point?

The price of the Proton Hotspot Miner will be about R10 000 ($670) for the first 200 devices. The price will hopefully be reduced when we source larger quantities of components for larger production runs and by eliminating unnecessary components from the design.

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline?

The forecast for production is as follow:
October 2021 – 10 x Proton Hotspot Miner
November 2021 – 20 x Proton Hotspot Miner
December 2021 – 50 x Proton Hotspot Miner
January 2022 – 100 x Proton Hotspot Miner
February 2022 – 500 x Proton Hotspot Miner
The MOQ supply of Hotspots will be revised during this process as we finalise the design, procurement of components and suppliers.


## Customer Support

For Helium products Atom Design and Innovation works in close collaboration with the Institute for Technology and Society to handle sales and first line support with more complex technical enquiries escalated to us. We aim to provide great customer service. We put all the experience and know-how in the field of IoT so we can answer your questions and offer our best product and services that is perfect for your application requirements. Additionally, our engineers and technicians span the whole of South Africa. 

## Hardware Security Element
For our current product, Proton Hotspot Miner and in line with the community consensus - we have adopted the ECC608 security element chip to increase the security of the swarm key. For future products we are evaluating more options including other security element chips.

## Manufacturing Information
We have extensive experience with developing and implementing our own radio-frequency (RF) networks for our IoT products. We manufactured and sold up to 500 of our own gateways. We also have experience with the Sigfox network, but due to uncertainties, all IoT devices will be reworked to communicate via the LoRa network. This will enable us to quickly deploy our first manufactured gateways to existing clients and to expand from this.

## Proof of Identity
To be submitted privately to DeWi. 

## Budget & Capital
Our budget is aligned with our expected production and delivery timeline as outlined above.

## Risks & Challenges
Sourcing components continues to be challenging in the current market – several supply chain issues affecting the whole industry – but we have secured enough stock to produce the quantities listed above.
