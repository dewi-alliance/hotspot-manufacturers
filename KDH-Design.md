## KDH Design Inc. 

Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19. .
## Summary
KDH Design Inc., with  a brand JARVISH, is developing smart IoT devices. Our team has vast experience and skill with both the technical and practical aspects of the industry and the main strength is system integration. We have plans to build a Light Hotspot and will harness our experience to build a robust solution. 

## Company Information (required)
KDH Design Inc. is an innovative company established in 2014 with the vision to bring superior design, high-quality accessible  products to consumers around the world. To reach the real Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and the Internet of Things (IoT), we planned to start from helmets. The smart helmet with the brand, JARVISH, we built could keep riders in connection while driving.

JARVISH smart helmet  launched the first shipping in the market in 2017 and has saled thouhands of devices since these years. The second step we planned is to build up the connection between riders and motorbikes. Through the specific communication box which is designed like an OBD unit, riders could be informed about the vehicle's data, e.g. residual oil quantity, speed, and etc. More, with establishing the wireless connectivity like Wi-Fi, LoRa, or 5G on the communication box, we could connect motorbikes to achieve Intelligent Transport System (ITS).

We considers smart helmets to be pioneering product and platform that will define an era, as well as products closely linked to consumer’s daily lives. Much like smartphones, firstly they were only cool high-tech gadgets, but quickly became an essential part of everyone’s daily life. In the near future, smart safety helmets will definitely be as common as smart phones.

## Product Information (required)
JARVISH L1 LoRaWAN Indoor Light Hotsopt

JARVISH L1 is a ready-to-use LoRaWAN indoor gateway compatible with Helium LongFi Network. Anyone can join The People's Network and provide hundreds of square miles of wireless network coverage while mining HNT on the Helium Blockchain just as hotspot miners do. JARVISH L1 can connect to The People’s Network within a few simple steps in minutes, and helps you build LoRa applications with low costs.

* What is your approximate price point? 
* What is your expected production and delivery timeline? 

## Previous shipments (required)
We have had a number of smart helmet models sold and shipped to the U.S., Taiwan, China, and Malaysia with FCC-approved.

## Which countries do you plan to ship to and get regulatory certifications for? (required) 
We'll focus on the US market, however, we welcome orders from other countries. We'll definitly get FCC certification, then work on certification for other countries or regions.

## Customer Support (required)
New order for JARVISH L1 is provided a 1-year warranty.

Customer service: Email and Discord channel.

We will replace or repair the product free of charge if the defects are caused due to reasons related to raw materials, designation, or manufacturing process. For repair cases, the repair is supposed to be completed within 25 working days after we received the return package. For replacement cases, we will arrange the shipment in 7 working days after we receive the returned defective device package. For replacement parts cases, we will arrange the shipment in 7 working days after the tech support ticket is completed.

## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email Dewi (christina@dewi.org).
* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No? 
  * Yes, we use ATECC608 encryption chip the swarm_key.
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or No? 
  * Not currently, working on this for future releases
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. 
  * Yes or No? Yes, we use ATECC608 encryption chip the swarm_key, and key is securely provisioned during manufacturing.
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. 
  * Yes or No? No Encrypted buses or potting.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No? 
  * Yes, we are willing to submit a prototype for audit and share results publicly.

## Hardware Information (required). Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?
  * We develop our own software App for setup and configuration of the devices
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? 
  * ATECC608
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (i.e. SX1302, SX1303, etc, only list one) 
  * SX1302 + SX1250
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs. 
* What is the CPU?
  * MIPS24Kec
* Other Hardware Specifications: 
  * See above

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? 
  * Yes
* Have you built gateways before? 
  * Yes
* How many gateways did you make? 
  * Over a few million units
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain. 
  * We are back one of the largest manufactuer in the world with $20 billions in revenue 
* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
  * Directly from component manufactuers or via qualified distributors
