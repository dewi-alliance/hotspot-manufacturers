## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files.        *  *Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email the Helium Foundation (christina@helium.foundation).*
* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No?
<br />***Yes***

<br />***Yes***
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
<br />***Yes***

<br />***Yes, we will use anti-tampering switch***
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
<br />***Yes***

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?

* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
<br />***We work with local distributors and suppliers. At the same time, we can supply components from international market distributors.***
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?

<br />***18000 pcs***
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
<br />***In the first stage, we have a budget of 500,000 dollars. We are planning to create the capital of the product that we can produce in the first 3 months with the pre-order stage and additional funding.***
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) 
<br />***Funding will be provided by transferring the additional income obtained by our company from other sectors in which it operates to the technology branch.**

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.

<br />***There is a risk of chipset crisis in the world, but there is no stock supply problem in the components we choose to use in the hardware, through the distributors we work with. We always have accessible stock in our selection of hardware components. We have gained a lot of experience in this regard in our previous works.***
