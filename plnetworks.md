**LoRa Gateway - over 2,000/year**
**LoRa NW Server - over 50/year**
* What brought you to the Helium Network? 
	From starting LoRa RF transceiver without LoRaWAN standard, we thought that this kind of RF feature is innovative and another part of RF solutions which is not existed in the world so that traditional building a network is not suitable to LoRa network construction and the business way of Helium network is innovative like LoRa RF transceiver. 

## Product Information (required)

	**Paid repair service: up to 3 year**

## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email the Helium Foundation (christina@helium.foundation).
* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No?
	**Yes. Built-in ECC608 crypto chip will be applied on PLG420**
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or No? 
	**Yes**
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
	**Yes , secured in ECC608 chip**
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No? (Please note, the final design will be audited against this statement. Do not answer 'yes' unless the design will have these features and a description of where they are implemented can be provided.)
**Yes, by ECC608 chip**
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
	**Yes**

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
	**Yes, our development team has several experience for RF equipment including 3GPP small sized station, Repeaters, Mobile WiMAX, Home RF Gateways, Wi-SUN Gateways and so on.** 
* Have you built gateways before?
	**Yes**
* How many gateways did you make?
	**Over the past 10 years, 10,000 gateways we developed was sold** 
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer or working with a partner? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
	**Local chip agency almost cases**
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 
	**We don't need any type of radio module and concentrators. we put Semtech chips on board directly.**

## Proof of Identity:
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from the Helium Foundation. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives. Details for this will be provided after your application has been submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales? 
	**over 2000**
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
	**There is no issue for budget.**
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) 
	**If the demand for hotspots is high and we need more budge than we expected, PLNetworks can cover it on its own since PLNetworks is making sufficient profits through product sales in the Korean LoRa Market.**
