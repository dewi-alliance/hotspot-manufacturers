> E-mail, Discord

* How long will the company provide customer support? 

> 1 year

* How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 

> We provide replacements parts for SoC module and LoRa module in reasonable price

## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email the Helium Foundation (christina@helium.foundation).
* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No? `Yes for ECC608`
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or No? `No.( Firmware includes GPLv3 software, we cannot fully encrypt and lock down the whole system. But we have encrypt and lock / verify core software with TrustZone Technology embedded in SoC)`
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No? `Yes, inside ECC608`
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No? (Please note, the final design will be audited against this statement. Do not answer 'yes' unless the design will have these features and a description of where they are implemented can be provided.) `No for ECC608.`
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No? `Yes.`

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?

> Adding hotpot via a QR code. The device will provide a Web Dashboard for controlling.

This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? `ECC608`
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs.)  `SX1303`
* What is the CPU? `Dual core ARM Cortex-A7`
* Other Hardware Specifications: 

> * 256MB RAM
> * 4GB eMMC
> * 5M digital camera with H264/H265 encoding (3072x1728 @ 30fps)
> * Giga Ethernet Interface with PoE

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? `Yes`
* Have you built gateways before?  `Yes`
* How many gateways did you make?  `1000 for customers`
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer or working with a partner? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain. `Shenzhen Naviecare Technology Ltd., and Taiwan Ushine Photonics`
* Where are you sourcing your components from? `SoC, DDR, eMMC from WPG, LoRa from Naviecare, ecc608 from direct order from Microchip and local sales representatives`
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? `10K / month`

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from the Helium Foundation. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives.
Details for this will be provided after your application has been submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales?  `3K`
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? `all 3K units requires $200K up-front, We get access to $100K for first batch of manufacturing.`
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.)  `We have volume customers will pay for devices up-front`

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.

> Global supply chain crisis is the biggest challenge, we will order SoC, DDR, LoRa modules long before production. We have good connections with chips and modules suppliers.
> In the meanwhile, this solution is unique in current applications, requiring many software development and tests efforts.
