## XOR TECHNOLOGIES LLP

Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19

## Summary

XOR Technologies LLP is one of the well known Electronics manufacturers in India incorporated in 2016 in New Delhi. Our experienced team of engineers and promoters have worked extensively in network based hardware development and manufacturing. 

We plan to manufacture Helium hotspots and further develop products to work on the Helium network. We truly believe that the Helium network has the potential to bring into life many products that previously were not finding the right network to run on.

We specialize in custom projects for our clients. We are a SEDEX certified manufacturer for social compliance and our quality management systems are certified by TUV Nord. 

## Company Information (required)

Interest in Helium: LORA is going to be the backbone for all things IOT

Our introduction to LORA came by way off a project for Indian defense services. An array of sensors was set up in open areas and communication was established using LORA. We have been in love with the technology ever since. Reading and understanding Helium has made us very excited about the prospect of this project.

## Product Information (required)

We are set to roll out our Standard Hotspot / Gateway for Indoor use at a price point of USD 350 ex-factory. 

We plan on selling an outdoor conversion kit in the near future post launch.

Hotspot configuration: 

Web apps can be used for software setup, configuration, and monitoring. This system can be easily implemented if needed but use of the Helium native APP will be our primary configuration route.

System upgrade process:

Daily system upgrade checks will be performed. Before the upgrade process (either firmware,packages,binaries), we will perform the hardware verification process first as the product we produce has a serial binding which is used to verify authenticity and unlock software permission.


Production and Delivery timeline:

The new XOR Standard Hotspot Miner will be released in December 2021.

## Customer Support (required)

For Helium products XOR Technologies will work closely with its sister company Quantum Hi-Tech Merchandising to handle distribution and customer support. We will have our engineers on standby round the clock as we understand the loss of network contributors in case of down time. Any complaints can be escalated to our team without delay and we shall provide quick resolution. Buffer stock of hotspots shall always be maintained to be shipped to customers in the highly unlikely situation of hardware failure. We shall provide a 1 year warranty for all our products and repair support will be available for at least 3 years post sale.
We will also be available across our social media channels which are now being developed dedicatedly for Helium project. We shall provide support also via Discord, email, live chat and telephonic calls.


## Hardware Security Element (required)


Encrypted/locked-down firmware - Yes

●	The firmware will be locked-down to the MAC ID. No one can duplicate the data of one device to another. The technology enables files to be transparently encrypted to protect confidential data from attackers with physical access to the device. This unique key will be generated while flashing the OS on the Hard Storage. 

●	Our gateways embed a Crypto Unit (ECC508A/ECC608A) to provide a wide set of encryption algorithms and cryptographic operations.

Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures - Yes

●	We are using the ECC608A chip for encrypted storage of swarm keys or API tokens.

Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures - No

●	We will work on encrypted buses, potting and stronger hardware anti-tampering measures in future variants of the product.

Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)- YES

●	We will submit samples for testing as and when required along the approval process.


## Hardware Information (required)

We are using Communication Concentrator based on Semtech SX1302/SX1303 radio chipsets. 

We are using ATECC608B and DS28C36 for encryption of the swarm_key.

Our components will be sourced from authorised distributors in Asia Pacific including India and China.

Our relationships with ditributors of all components because of our vast experience in manufacturing will help us to secure a steady supply of LORA Modules and other relavent components. We will innitially begin with 10k units and scale up to 50k units per month.

## Manufacturing Information (required)

Production Unit:

In our production area of 35000 square feet, we employ over 300 people and run 11 production lines with state-of-the-art testing equipment. We have quality engineers at each line along with supervisors. 

Here is a glimpse of our manufacturing unit located in New Delhi, India. https://youtu.be/WII4SYAnF3M

Past Experience:

We have built and delivered several bluetooth and wifi enabled devices. We have also delivered custom LORA based projects for defence use which included over 200 gateways and 10,000 nodes in mesh configuration.


## Proof of Identity

To be submitted Privately to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital (required)

We estimate that our current spare capacity shall be sufficient to roll out over 80,000 Helium hotspots per month with ease and with minimal investment. 
We will use our currently unused credit line of over 1 Million USD to kickstart procurement. We have our lead investor and promoter group on board for further funding if required upto an additional 1 Million USD.

## Risks & Challenges (required)

The only challenge that can derail any manufacturer of these products is supply line disruptions because of global semiconductor shortage. Lead times for components are at an all time high. We shall make sure to strictly comply with committed timelines and ensure customers get delivery on time by taking orders only when all raw material is ready with us.
