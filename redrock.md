We will invest $500,000 more for the mass production.
* **What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.)**<br/> 
We can obtain financial support through reliable investment partner if needed. 
## Risks & Challenges (required)
**Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.**<br/>
The shortage of chips could be challenging in the current market, which affects the whole industry, but we have enough stock to produce the above quantity of products.<br/>
Because of the Covid-19 pandemic and China’s strict epidemic prevention policy, there may be possible delays in transportation and maintenance of our products. Our partner, [AGI Link Cargo](http://www.agizs.com/index.php?siteid=2), can provide us international logistics services, and will help us mitigate these problems.
