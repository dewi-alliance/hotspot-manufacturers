## Company Information
The company is a startup envisioned to develop innovative products, software and hardware alike, in its social oriented quest to make technology available and affordable for all people. 
The startup was created in this particular moment because we believe in the Helium project and in our capacity of excelling as an innovative and reliable third-party manufacturer. With that in mind, we will acquire the financial resources needed for finalize our two undergoing projects into global available and reliable products.  
We have an aggregate (team and partner support) experience of over 40 years in fields like design and manufacturing of electronics, hardware development and configurations, software development and optimization, communications, developing own brands and products, quality control, traditional and online commerce, distribution, operating with and securing supplier chains, manufacturing custom/atypical client orientated products. In this aggregate logic we reached over 1.4 million clients (both companies and end-users) with various products (over 36 million sold) from above the above-mentioned fields.


## Product Information
We have developed a simple (by conception and design) and yet most efficient and reliable full hotspot that is future-oriented (8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM) for a competitive price. This product will be the first of the HeLFi hotspot range.
For three months now, we are extensively testing prototypes with very encouraging results.
Samples can be provided to DeWi and/or Helium and be submitted to any tests.
Software setup and configuration for the devices will be done via Helium's official app. 
Our company will be able to start production and delivery in 45 days after completing your hardware audit process. In the first phase of development, we will be able to deliver 30,000 HeLFi hotspot range products/year in a constant daily rhythm. 
The products of the HeLFi hotspot range will meet the highest quality and security standards due to our own company implemented protocols and procedures, respectively to our suppliers CE & FCC approved parts and components.
We have already initiated the intern process for obtaining CE and FCC approval for the HeLFi hotspot range.
In 30 days from starting production, we will initiate the intern process for obtaining all other regulatory approves necessary for world-wide distribution.


## What is your approximate price point?

Our indoor HeLFi full hotspot will have an approximate price point of US $430 taxes not included.

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts

We have extensively tested prototypes with very encouraging results.
Samples will be provided to DeWi and/or Helium to be submitted to any tests.
All of the software setup and configuration for the device will be done via Helium's official app.
Also, all of our detailed hardware desings will be submitted to DeWi and/or Helium together with the samples for audit.

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline?

Our company will be able to start production in 50 days after sucsessfully passsing Helium/DeWi Hardware Audit Process.
Delivery of the HeLFi Hotspots will be fullfilled in approximately 10 days after starting production.

This timetable can be fulfilled only if MOC Apporoval doesn't take longer than 15 days from the point of passing DeWi/Helium's Hardware Audit.

## Previous shipments

We are a startup. Even so we have an aggregate experience (as described in the Company Information section) of world-wide shipping and services (especially apps). Even so, our primary general market is Romania, both in terms of traditional and online commerce (significant and constant presence on the biggest national marketplace). The second presence as relevance (software and IT&C products mainly) is represented by the biggest world marketplaces. Until now, we have shipped both CE and FCC approved products.
We intend to ship the products of the HeLFi hotspot range world-wide. 

## Startups welcome! 
* Have you shipped anything in the past? Yes we have, as described in the section above.
* We have shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products in EU countries.
* We gradually plan to ship our products worldwide.

## Customer Support

Our site will have a dedicated, mobile oriented, section for customer support. We commit to develop and permanently upgrade a software solution, intuitive and client oriented (video and graphic tutorials, troubleshooting), that will solve any problems that may appear. We will also have a dedicated email for this section with a response time within the same working day, for problems that couldn’t be solved using the software solution and, we will have a Discord channel. For shipping information will provide a different dedicated email.
The customer support services will be provided for the entire lifetime of each HeLFi hotspot range product.
The HeLFi hotspot range products will have a 2-year warranty, period in which there will be only replacements. After that period, the repair and shipping costs will be supported by the customer.


## Hardware Security Element

For each of our products, we will seriously review and take measures to protect the privacy and security of our customers. Our hotspot is integrated with the ECC608 security solution to increase the security of the swarmkey, firmware and device root password will be encrypted as recommended by Helium.
The company will submit a series of prototypes of the HeLFi hotspot range product for audit and will share those audit results publicly.


## Hardware Information

•	Anti-tamper/encrypted concentrator based on Semtech SX1302/SX1303 (anchor gateway)
•	Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz
•	8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM
•	2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz IEEE 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 5.0, BLE
•	Gigabit Ethernet
•	32GB Micro-SD card
•	Built-in heatsinks for better temperature management
•	Support for PoE+ (802.3at) PD
•	Power over Ethernet (PoE) enabled (requires separate PoE HAT)
•	Operating temperature: 0 – 50 degrees C ambient
•	Different methods of onboarding (BLE, local web onboarding, remote onboarding)

In short to medium time frame components for the HeLFi hotspot range will be supplied from China,Turkey and Romania.
For the moment we have been able to secure the procurement of 3,000 radio modules/concentrators per month, during a period of 1 year, with a variable price conditionality. 

## Manufacturing Information
Two of three shareholders and two future employees (of which we are certain at this moment but presumably more) have previously worked in successful companies that built and delivered hardware and communications projects before (millions of such products). 
The HeLFi hotspot range will be produced in a dedicated facility designed and built specially for this purpose, in a location that permits the immediate expansion. By doing that, we will ensure that the production of the HeLFi hotspot range will meet the highest efficiency, quality and security standards.
For achieving these objectives, we have obtained a significant and dedicated partner support (logistical, operational and financial) in order to ensure the sustainable development of the company and the rapid overcoming of all eventual problems or shortages that may appear.

## Proof of Identity
We will submit the proof of identity under the terms of HIP.

## Budget & Capital

In the present configuration of the business, we will be able to make and hopefully sell up to 55,000 products of the HeLFi hotspot range per year.
We prepared enough funds for sustaining the:
-	buildup and endowment of the production facility (with the participation of one of the members of the partner support).
-	supply chain for a period of one month (with the participation of one of the members of the partner support) and for more we will rely on the orders we will cash in.
-	production costs for a for a period of two months, and for more we will rely on the orders we will cash in.
Besides that, the shareholders have on-spot open credit in 2 national banks for a total of 340,000 USD.



## Risks & Challenges
-	Perfecting a system dedicated for offering support to consumers of different skill level regarding Helium project can be challenging
Our best specialists will be continuously dedicated to this task.
-	Possible increasing costs of components and shipments
-	Delays of our suppliers in the process of manufacturing the components - Since Day 1 we are working towards finding new trusted suppliers through
which we can mitigate these risks.
