## Shenzhen Yingzhi Information Technology Co., Ltd.  
Product: Aura Light Hotspot.  
Application to become an approved third-party manufacturer as per HIP19.
## Summary
Shenzhen Yingzhi Information Technology Co., Ltd. has been providing industrial AI and IoT solutions with ISO9001 certified, since 2018. Using this experiences, we develop two main production lines. The first one is smart Bluetooth audio devices (registered trademark 'VOHECHS') and the main market is in the US. Another major direction of Yingzhi is the AI+IoT projects in Mainland China. We develop integrated AI gateway (based on Nvidia TX1 as shown in the image below) to collect and process the data of AI cameras and the LoRa modules (such as LoRa Smart ID card). The gateway can be used to intelligently manage the industrial parks and campuses. The corresponding LoRa modules are provided by Shenzhen [Naviecare](http://www.naviecare.com/#), which is also our LoRa module supplier for the AURA Light Hotspot to the Helium Network.

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?  
Yes. In our AI-IOT project in China, we build the integrated AI gateway to collect and process the data from AI cameras and the LoRa module and intelligently manage the industrial parks and campuses. The LoRa module includes the LoRa concentrator integrated in the AI gateway and the LoRa card used to locate a specific person or object. 
* Have you built gateways before?  
Yes, in the AI-IOT project described upwards. 
* How many gateways did you make?  
We've made 200 AI gateways and more than 3k LoRa cards in the project.
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third-party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.    
Most manufacturing works are done by ourselves with ISO 9001 certification. The LoRa modules are provided by a third-party manufacturer. Shenzhen Naviecare is our initial LoRa module provider. Naviecare is also the official partner with Semtech and LoRa Alliance.

* Where are you sourcing your components from?   
As described upwards, we've ordered enough LoRa modules from Shenzhen NaiveCare to get ready for our first batch of mass production. Except for the LoRa module, there are three other important components in AURA Light Hotspot: Rockpi 4B+ mainboard, LoRa communication adapter board, and ECC608 chip. For Rockpi 4B+ and ECC608, we've prepared enough stocks for the first batch of mass production. As for the adapter board, we have made over 100 pieces in the PCB factory for testing and verification. PCB Factory can fully meet our requirements for production capacity (>30k/Month).

* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?   
We've prepared 3k LoRa modules for our first batch of production. At the same time, we have booked the monthly supply of 5K from Naviecare in advance.
The booking order may be dynamically adjusted according to the specific shipment volume.

## Proof of Identity:
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives.
Details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales?   
20k~40k in the first six months. First batch 3k and the following 5k/month.
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to?   
Have funded USD 2M for Helium Hotspot project kick-off, may increase investment to USD 3~5M depending on the market.
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.)  
First of all, we will try our best to control the budget within USD 3M. If there is an additional need for this project, our potential shareholder has been in electronic manufacturing for 10 years owns several profitable manufacturing companies, and has sufficient capital to fund this project. 

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.  
- Risk1: Shortage of LoRa Module and the corresponding Concentrate IC
- Our Solution: Closely work with several powerful providers including NaiveCare and set the pre-paid orders in advance of the mass production.
- Risk2: Security IC: Microchip ATECC608 is a shortage in the market. 
- Our Solution: We've pre-ordered enough ECC608 for our first batch production. Same as the LoRa module, we have built very good business relationships with several chip suppliers and we will set the pre-paid orders in advance of the mass production.
