  YES

## Hardware Information (required). Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.

Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.

- What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?
  will remote updates via OTA and configue  wifi settings via app which is  compatible Android and IOS.

- Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using?
