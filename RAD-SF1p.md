## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured.

* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No? No.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No? Yes.

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices? This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.	We will implement onboarding by QR code, internet interface will be cellular or ethernet or fiber cable. Upgrading remotely by FOTA.
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? ECC608.
